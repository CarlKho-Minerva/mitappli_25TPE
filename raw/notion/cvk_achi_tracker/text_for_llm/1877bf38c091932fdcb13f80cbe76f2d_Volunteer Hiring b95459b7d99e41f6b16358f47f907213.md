It's scholarship season! If you're like me, you have probably searched far and wide for a scholarship para college. And if you're also like me, nagkugi ka ug organize sa mga links para ma review nimo later, wasting your time.

I want to eliminate the hassle of doing this so I am starting an initiative called Padayon.Ko. Website siya nga mulist sa tanan available scholarships in an organized manner (see picture sent). Daghan na akong nagather nga mga scholarship opportunities (70+ nationwide), and kailangan ko ug tabang para mabutang ang tanan sa website + facebook page for launching on October 30.

Medjo long term commitment ni siya, so you must be passionate in helping out your fellow students jud. The following people are needed:

2 Graphic Designers

Don't worry, templates are provided. All you have to is replace images and export images.

2 people who will schedule posts 

Don't worry, templates are provided for the captions. 

4 Scholarship Curators

You guys will mainly be copying and pasting information. Your primary task is to create cards for every scholarship opportunity. 

I will be teaching you your tasks on Sunday (10-24), 10:00 AM - 12:00 NN. So please feel free to PM me if you are interested. Salamat ug padayun ta para sa atong kaugmaon!
