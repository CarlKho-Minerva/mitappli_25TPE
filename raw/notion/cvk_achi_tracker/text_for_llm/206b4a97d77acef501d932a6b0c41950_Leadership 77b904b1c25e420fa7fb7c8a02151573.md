As a junior high school student, Carl loved joining Science Investigatory Projects. As a result, he would be also came to fall in love with hackathons. It's what kept him busy during the quarantine. Ideating, prototyping, and pitching. Carl loved every second of the thrill. Although he usually worked alone, hackathons forced him to go outside of his comfort zone and lead teams like the natural leader he was sought out to be.

Because of that, Carl and his team won the nationwide Cebuana Lhullier FinLit Innovation Challenge with their concept of gamifying education to alleviate poverty in the form of Plutus: The Money Game. This game went on to help a Zamboanga initiative called Kids Who Farm.

An honorable mention is his team being the only Philippines team in Singapore International Foundation's ClimateHack 2021. Their solution? Dump.Waste. Their app aimed to visualize data and initiate cleanups in the battle against fly-tipping (littering). Dump.Waste bested 500 other entries from different ASEAN countries.
