- **Represented the Philippines as Captain of the RoboSoccer team at the World Robotics Olympiad 2019 at Hungary after besting 7 national teams with the proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller.**
    
    8/2018 - 9/2019
    
    I participated in the World Robotics Olympiad (WRO) for four consecutive years as team captain and an algorithm engineer in Robot Soccer. Before that, I had to learn self-correcting algorithms, such as the proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller on my own while championing my team through the Lapu-Lapu division level against three teams, then the nationals: where we won 3rd of the eight participating schools nationwide. We represented the Philippines on the WRO-2018 Invitationals and placed 10th; on WRO-2019 and placed 6th in our bracket.

- **Raised ₱148,851.26 and sent 126 gadgets to help families continue their children's distance learning during the pandemic.**
    
    06/2020 - 03/2022
    
    I was the marketing creative lead of One Gadget One Child (1G1C), an initiative helping students transition to online distance learning. With a team of 24, we gathered 126 gadgets both new and pre-loved—repaired some if they were broken—then we sent it to screened recipients with the assistance of Bidlisiw Foundation, an NGO helping us screen recipients from cyber-terrorists. Apart from that, 1G1C also raised ₱148,851.26 and used the money to buy tablets to cater more families in need.

- **Received ₱20,000 in funding for further development of Plutus - The Money Game to gamify financial education for underserved communities.**
    
    4/2021 - 5/2021
    
    Led a team of four talented-but-academically-closeted friends from elementary school to develop a solution from start to finish. From over 50 participants around the Philippines, our Dumb-ways-to-Die-inspired game hoping to increase financial literacy in underserved communities, was part of the five winners in the student category who received PHP 20,000.00 to scale. Today, the game can be accessed at [https://saidus.itch.io/plutus](https://saidus.itch.io/plutus) and has 97 plays.

- **Won the master prize and designer prize against 18 artists SEA-wide respectively and received nationwide media coverage by photobashing Simala Sanctuary de Cebu for the Overwatch SEA Map Design Contest.**
    
    06/2020 - 07/2020
    
    For this art contest, I learned photobashing and created Simala Sanctuary de Cebu. My entry was one of 18 finalists from professional across South East Asia. I learned how to ask for feedback; this expanded my knowledge and network. To get votes, I looked for volunteers to help me share and directly message the media. This strategy worked as I landed in three broadcasts and nine articles in the national media. I won 6th place in the skill-based contest and 3rd place in the vote-based contest.

The first link shows the number of finalists, while the second link displays the winners. The two final links show the 3 national broadcasts I've been featured in. For the email conversation, I have followed up, but still have not received a certificate. I have included the links of all 10 articles feature in a notepad file. Last two is the artwork.

- **Inspired 40,000+ Filipinos by talking about my research-based innovations for the Department of Education Philippines, Google PH, and more.**
    
    07/2021 - 08/2021
    
    Before the pandemic, I enjoyed winning science and robotics fairs. During the pandemic, I learned UI/UX and championed 6 projects. On July 27, 2021, teacher Ruby from the Department of Education PH invited me to give a virtual tech talk. I spoke with people from Microsoft, Canada, U.S.A, and De La Salle University (DLSU). Collectively, there were 38,457 viewers. Later, I talked to 21 students in Canada for their passion project. I started mentoring and my mentees are nationally applauded.

- **Helped 6,601 victims locate essential resources while raising ₱340,900.00 after Super Typhoon Rai by co-developing Tabangay Ta.**
    
    12/21 - 01/22
    
    I worked with 21 developers around the Philippines to improve the essentials-sharing with crowd-sourcing web app Tabangay Ta. This was to rise from typhoon Rai, 2021's second-deadliest disaster. As 2nd-in-command, I delegated priority features to be shipped and offline versions to work on. From analytics, we have received 1,235 updates from the people.
    
    I also helped the marketing team raise a total of ₱340,900.00 and donated 34 generators to 8 cities by managing the team's social media.
