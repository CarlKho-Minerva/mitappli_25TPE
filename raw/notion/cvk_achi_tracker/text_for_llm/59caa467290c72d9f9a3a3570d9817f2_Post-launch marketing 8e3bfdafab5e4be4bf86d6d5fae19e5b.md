Wohoo! Thanks for the successful launch, guys. We currently have 3 users-for Firefox of course.
The butterfly effect is a browser extension made to help remind you guys to drink water / stretch / take a breath of fresh air.

Hi! Thank you for giving positive feedback regarding the health extension I made. I just wanted to let you know nga it's out, for free, in Mozilla Firefox!

I DO need help in taking it to Google Chrome though, but it requires a one-time 5$ payment. If you want to aide me in my endeavor, you can send financial assistance on GCash 09166971499. Thank you!
