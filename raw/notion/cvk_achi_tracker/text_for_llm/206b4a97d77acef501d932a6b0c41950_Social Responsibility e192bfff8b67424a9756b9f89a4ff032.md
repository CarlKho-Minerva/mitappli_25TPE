# Social Responsibility

Because of the pandemic: education has become a privilege and not a right. To mitigate this, Carl volunteered for 1 Gadget 1 Child, an initiative by a group of Cebuano volunteers aiding e-learners by redistributing pre-loved gadgets despite having no experience in doing so. He was the creative marketing lead and was in charge of updating the donors about their donated gadgets, as well as the amount of the raised funds through graphics. The initiative was featured in Rappler, CDN, and more. In the end, the 1G1C team managed to provide 70 pre-loved and new gadgets to 70 deserving and happy families.

Currently, Carl is working with The Workbooth in Iba, Basak: A co-working space initiative giving internet access for cheap. He is also in charge of the monthly newsletter of Glory Rebornâ€”another initiative providing compassionate and holistic care to marginalized moms and babies of Cebu.
