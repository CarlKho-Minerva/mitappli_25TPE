# GBA Essay: #SaktongKabataan: Basakanon Youth Deserves Better

Created: October 16, 2021 11:53 PM

All my achievements were made possible by privilege. I pursued challenges because I was capable of doing so accessibility-wise. I had time to formulate entries for multiple contests because I did not have to worry about not eating the next day, looking for ways to feed my mouth did not cross my mind because I already had food on the table. In other words, I am the success I am today because I did not have to suffer from poverty. I have access to education and the tools required to act on information.

#BasakanonYouthDeservesBetter. Where "better" in this hashtag is better, wider access to education for the youth. Having more dreamers achieve their goals could, in turn, lead to a higher rate of poverty alleviation in Basak.

I remember interviewing our mayor, Hon. Junard "Ahong" Chan after the courtesy call upon returning from the World Robotics Olympiad nationals for 2019. I asked him about his plans for the students of Lapu-Lapu City. A standout response I remember is his promise to open an e-library for free research and printing. A few months later, during our preparations for the international stage, we utilized the free E-Library to improve our robot on-site. However, a new problem arose when I had to wait for a computer--there were still not enough computers to use. This led me to volunteer in pro-education initiatives like One Gadget One Child and The Workbooth.

What are the costs of continued COVID-19 school closures? A study by UNICEF conducted in 2013 answers this question: The longer students are out of the classroom, the less likely they are to return - and the higher the risk of child labour, child marriage, early pregnancy, violence and abuse.

I hope to be the instrument God wants me to be. I dream of a Basak with educated citizens, where every student is supported with every goal achieved in one way or another.
