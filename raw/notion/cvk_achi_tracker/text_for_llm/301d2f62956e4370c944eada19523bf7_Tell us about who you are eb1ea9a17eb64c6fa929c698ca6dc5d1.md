# Tell us about who you are.

I am known to go beyond textbooks and identify problems affecting people—then I would solve it. Throughout every endeavour, I played different roles: I was the leader, the engineer, the photographer, the artist, the researcher, and more. These skills were learned out of sheer curiosity fuelled by a strong motivation: deadlines.

In the eyes of the people I have made an impression on, I am an enterprising and passionate pioneer. During junior high school, I was praised for being the captain of the first-generation Lego EV3 players who carried the Philippine Flag in the World Robotics Olympiad despite a lack of coaching and financial resources. During my time at a tech company in Cebu, I made myself an indispensable developer/designer by advocating for no-code tools to create websites. Presently, four major projects are using the said tool.

When I look at myself in the mirror, I see a problem solver. A "conveniator" or someone who makes things convenient for efficiency. This is how I built my reputation as an innovator—I share my solutions with the world to help others with the same difficulties. From a health reminder extension to combating climate change by utilizing our smartphone and social media addiction.

I innovate, be it at home, work, or school. I solve my problems and share my solutions to the world. These are usually made with the help of new concepts, methods, and tools. This is why I dub myself as "The Pioneer".
