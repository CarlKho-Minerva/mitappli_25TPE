    I am known for leading the flag of a small high school in the Philippines to the World Robotics Olympiad in Hungary. However, the challenges behind this success included embarrassing my school by always being in last place, as well as learning a lot of calculus too advanced for my level, then convincing people for financial support. This essay will cover the story of how I led my team to the international stage through years of trial and error with a stroke of bold, last-minute decisions.
    
    My first year in Marigondon National High School (MNHS) also happened to be the time when the school of 5,000 junior high school students received their first Lego EV3 kit. Though I was only a freshman with zero experience, I was delegated to be the team captain and algorithm engineer due to my experience in web development—which was self-taught—and major interest in what I called "learnable robotics". In my first competition, the First Lego League (FLL), I broke down and cried. Then, for the next three years, our robot would continue to be the last placer on the leaderboard. 
    
    September 5, 2019. Hoops Dome Arena at Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. I could already foresee our loss in the regular category, so as the team captain, I made a wild decision: I convinced the organizers to switch categories; from the robot obstacle course to robot soccer. We broke down the robot we spent months perfecting, and, with our passion reignited by hope and confidence thanks to experience, rebuilt it to fit a completely new world. We were only given five minutes to build and code on the spot for the new category as the matches were already starting. We won 3rd place that day and qualified for the nationals.
    
    Long story short, in the nationals, my team was banned from playing until we modified our build. We did not have the appropriate sensors. The parts used in our robots were compromises since our school was not financially capable enough to provide us with the proper sensor to detect the infrared ball. We, however, carried on with unorthodox methods, utilizing the other sensors allowed in. Like Iron Man making the clunky first version of his suit. Surprisingly, we made it to the semi-finals and represented the Philippines in the WRO 2018 Invitationals. The following year, we continued the same path and thankfully made it to the nationals again. The only difference was the community in Lapu-Lapu lent us parts. We also tapped into an engineer for guidance. He played a significant role in our success by somehow managing to introduce us to the P.I.D. Control System: a self-correcting algorithm, two days before the nationals. I vividly remember the night in Manila before the competition proper: two timid grade 10 students studying a few college-level engineering concepts in hopes of getting into the internationals taking place at Györ, Hungary. During the contest proper, we prayed, played, made a few friends from Claret School of Quezon, prayed and played with said new friends, then we managed to score a goal—both metaphorically and literally—by getting 3rd place, securing my team a spot in the internationals.
    
    Before the glorious nights in Europe, we were faced with yet another financial dilemma: the money needed to fund our flight and stay in Hungary. We knocked on many doors, hoping for kind hearts to open up. It was a long, but rewarding journey. In the end, the mayor of Lapu-Lapu City, Hon. Ahong Chan came to our aid. A core memory that will forever inspire me and my team. As I waved the Philippine flag in glory on the stages of Edutus University, I could not help but be grateful to God, my family, my educators, and myself for not giving up. Clichè as it may be, failure and experience really are life's greatest teachers. It may be hard, but it is not impossible.
