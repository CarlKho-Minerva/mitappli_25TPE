It is with great honor for me to recommend Carl for the international scholars admission to UBC. Carl is a self-driven, high-performing student who goes above and beyond in every endeavor. In my two years of knowing him, I have witnessed Carl grow from someone who shoulders every workload, especially in my research projects because of his high standards—he is technologically advanced, to being a likeable leader who gives equal care and attention to his learning group members.

A good problem that I am experiencing with Carl, however, is his tendency to overcommunicate about updates on his project. I can see this being helpful in companies with real projects. This reverberates well with his vocal and written reasoning ability, especially in impromptu scenarios. In every oral recitation, I have observed Carl to practice scientific thinking and make a conscious effort to avoid the obvious answer. 

Outside of academics is where Carl shines the brightest. I am intrigued by his way of learning, he garners wisdom from joining one contest to another. He is a fan of "hackathons", where you create an innovative solution to address a real problem. His telemedicine project "Stat" won multiple awards such as the Philippines' National Science and Engineering Fair. I am a proud coach. As his research adviser, it is with pride for me to say that he was my first student to get his research paper published on Google Scholar. 

Carl's personal qualities are also well-honed. He has joined and founded an initiative that helps with a more equal access to education. We at STEC-SHS have exhausted all of our options. Carl's maturity has led me to believe that he is capable of attending UBC in his goal to become a researcher. I genuinely hope you will be able to accommodate him.

### Provide information on the Nominee’s involvement in extra-curricular, volunteer and community activities:

```markdown
Even before Carl studied at STEC-SHS, I have encountered him every year for four years at Science fairs. It is rare to witness the same student come back with novel concepts, as research is usually a task despised by students. It is the same story for Carl's yearly endeavors in the World Robotics Olympiad. For years, his team has always been at the bottom of the list, but in his final year in junior high school, he led his team and topped the nationals, representing the Philippines in Hungary.

Carl does not stop there, during the pandemic, he has won the hearts of Singapore with his trash mapping innovation called Dump.Waste. Now, in his latest research project, he is creating an Electronic Medical Record for small-scale physicians to aid them in the pandemic situation for free.

Being thoughtful and selfless is also one of Carl's commendable qualities. He volunteered for One Gadget One Child, an initiative that provides gadgets to students unable to attend online classes due to the lack of thereof. Currently, he has started an initiative, curating a list of scholarships. I think Carl is a holistic individual with the potential to better the world's way of life.
