## Jarrhey de la Peña

***Chief Operating Officer at Symph | [jarrhey@symph.co](mailto:jarrhey@symph.co)***

Carl has been a proactive and productive intern at Symph.

I worked with Carl on different design projects. He impressed me with his bold imagination and delivers when clients have out-of-the-box requests. On team activities, Carl made sure to make it fun when he's leading, and creative in execution.

## Gerb Reign Inajada

***Vice President, Chief Technology and Data Officer, Unionbank X (UBX) Philippines | [gerb.inajada@gmail.com](mailto:gerb.inajada@gmail.com)***

Carl Kho is one passionate young fellow.

I've always admired Carl's work ethic and output. You can rely on Carl to deliver great results with very little supervision. Even at quite a young age, Carl has had valuable experience collaborating with teams in real-world work scenarios. He has great potential and have also acquired skills and competencies most of his peers wouldn't have.

If you need something done well, you can definitely count on Carl to do it.

## Lenli Tuhoy

***Marketing Lead at Symph | [lenli@symph.co](mailto:lenli@symph.co)***

I've worked with Carl on over 3 projects (1 charity initiative and the rest work-related) and his performance in all these projects is consistent. Aside from counting on his skills in branding, graphic design, and video production among others, I can always rely on him to deliver. He needs no supervision and he just gets things done well. I've never been disappointed with his outputs.

What also stands out about Carl is his passion. His love for what he does is really evident in his enthusiasm for working on these things. This enthusiasm is contagious to us, the people he works with. He also handles things very professionally, takes and gives feedback really well, very proactive, and is always hungry for growth.

## Jaiun Roa

***Project Manager at Symph | [jaiun@symph.co](mailto:jaiun@symph.co)***

Carl Kho is one of the people who stood out as an intern in Symph.

He showed his skills as a designer and beginner developer. He always shows enthusiasm with his tasks and isn't afraid to show us what he's got. What amazed me is how he managed to joined multiple contests while formally studying and interning. It just shows how much he loves to improve on his craft and grow. Very humble, has initiative, and always hardworking — Carl is someone I will always love working with.

## Ma. Theresa L. Zapanta

***STEC SHS Teacher at DepEd | [matheresa.zapanta@deped.gov.ph](mailto:matheresa.zapanta@deped.gov.ph)***

I have known him since he was my 11th grade advisory student under the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) strand. He was also a student from two of my subjects last school year. Carl distinguished himself in my courses by receiving the highest grade in the class. But this accomplishment only scratches the surface of his ability and character. He is the type of person who has a thirst for learning. He's one of those rare people who works very hard and diligently, but does so with a smile on his face. He constantly strives for excellence and has received numerous awards in and out of the academe. He is a scientific humanist, I would say, with a genuine care for others marked by being a digital product designer. It should come as no surprise that Carl is well-liked and admired by his peers. To drive my point home, he's potentially the next Elon Musk.
