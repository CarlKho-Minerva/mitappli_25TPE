HEADING

## "When you can't help many, help one." - Mother Theresa

Beyond wordsâ€”Carl takes action for those who needs help.

Carl has a soft spot for disadvantaged hardworking individuals. This is why he takes time in helping his fellow students check feasibility for their upcoming papers. The pandemic only worsened living conditions for the marginalized, especially students. Carl was fortunate enough to volunteer for One Gadget One Child, an initiative that provides deserving students with a gadget for online class.
