# What is important to you? And why?

The ideal person works with his heart and his mind—both figuratively and literally. As an aspiring research scientist, I find three things important: value, passion, and most importantly, smiling.

Whether it is about thinking, learning, or speaking, being passionate about helping people with research taught me about people and ideas. Life has taught me that every word and action bears underlying **value**, especially in ideas from those who are usually belittled. This thinking moved my attitude away from doing everything alone, to me happily sharing the load.

There are also times where I also share resources to help a person with their growth, only to be dismayed upon finding out that they did not do anything about what they are seemingly passionate about. This is why I particularly value **passion**, it supercharges individuals to go above and beyond. An invisible force. Passion has carried me from being a regular student to being someone who seizes the opportunity to help in every encounter.

Lastly, I love **smiling**. It helps me regain my humanity after working on ideas day after day. Seeing smiles motivates me to do even better things for the world. The smiles I have received from seeing the less privileged receive their gadgets with the help of One Gadget One Child, an initiative I was involved with, pushes me to become an even brighter beacon of light.

Acknowledging the underlying value in every expended effort, especially by those with a smile motivates me to continue pursuing my goals passionately. With hopes of being the medium that enables others to do the same as well.

- Value, passion, and smiling.
- Value
    - Whether it be on thinking, learning, speaking.
        - studying UX & Research taught me in life that everything has value
        - Underlying value. Others who can't express well potential value.
- Passion
    - I discovered the harsh reality of passion by spoonfeeding sources for improvement to someone, but they didn't act on it.
    - There is always something that makes someone move, do things
    - If no passion, then just try. Even if you have, try. Nice for mitigating burnout.
- Smiling
    - Seeing people with a smile because they are enjoying the moment is very contagious to the point that it is addicting.
    - I like to keep the smile of my mother proud, the smiles of children who received a gadget for studies
    - I will work hard to keep the smile even after the world is constantly getting destruxted
- CONCLUSION
    - Acknowledging the underlying value in every expended efforts by humans, especially those with a smile fuels me to continue pursuing my goals passionately. With hopes of being the medium that enabled others to do the same.
