Greetings,

Hi, my name is Carl from the Philippines. My senior high school, STEC-SHS, provided our first term grades earlier than expected. Initially, they announced that our first term grades be released on January 2022. However, I have was called to receive my grades yesterday. 

Thus, I will be resubmitting my grades with the addition of the expected topics to be handled in our second semester. In case editing the content via the website's backend takes time, I have uploaded my Certified Secondary Students' Permanent Record in STEC Senior High School and MNHS Junior High School here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ubx6vn6D9UtigOfDJ3PlAqfcWz0WFoPB/view?usp=sharing.

Thank you for your kind consideration.

Carl Kho
