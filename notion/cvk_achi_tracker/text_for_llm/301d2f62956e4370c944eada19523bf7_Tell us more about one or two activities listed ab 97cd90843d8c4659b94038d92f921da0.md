STAT - YOUR VIRTUAL CLINIC

When a mother and her daughter were immobilized from setting foot in a physical clinic, I knew I had to step in. Ever since junior high, I loved solving problems with technology. Proven by my yearly participation in science fairs; I learn by making. COVID-19 discouraged physical projects, and so I turned to apps for a solution. 

Later down the road, SFTech started a UX Contest. I entered with my telemedicine idea. However, my only experience was graphic design in Canva, I had to learn the ropes in product development. From user research to building and testing the usability of the app prototype. The deadline helped me produce a prototype, complete with the feedback of doctors and I.T. professionals within one week. Research was vital since it helped me choose between which features to include for maximum efficiency. 

Stat was named champion of the SFTech UX Contest, the National Science and Engineering Fair, and the Social Innovation for Health Initiative award. It also opened doors for my first job as a product designer at Symph. However, what made me happy was the discovery of the mother and daughter's safety as they used a live telemedicine app as inspired by Stat. 

ONE GADGET ONE CHILD (1G1C)

Two months before September, the commencement of Online Distance Learning was announced by the department of education. It made cellphones and the internet a requirement, this worsened the divide in the access to equal education. 

As soon as I saw 1G1C's announcement of how they were starting an initiative donating gadgets to students, I wanted to help. I realized that they could grab more attention with better graphics, I messaged the leader despite being not that confident with my skills. I was made in charge of the branding and all multimedia. 

It was a meaningful and wholesome experience. Reading the letters written by the recipients made me feel so grateful—thankful that I was about to use my talent this way. As we wrapped up our initiative almost one year later, I could only cry as I was shown the 70 families who received a gadget.

## Stat - your virtual clinic

When a mother and her daughter was immobilized from setting foot on a physical clinic, I knew I had to step in. Ever since junior high, I loved solving problems with technology as proven by my yearly participation of science fairs. I learned by making. COVID-19 discouraged physical projects, and so I turned to apps for a solution.

It was of great timing for me to discover SFTech's UX Contest. Note that my only experience was graphic design in Canva, so I had to intensively learn the ropes in product development. From user research, to building and testing the usability of the prototype I made with Figma, a software for UI designs. Because of the deadline, I managed to produce a prototype, complete with the feedback of doctors and I.T. professionals within one week. Knowing which features to include for maximum efficiency did not come from thin air, so the role of research was vital. My efforts paid off, as my telemedicine app concept,"Stat - your virtual clinic", won the competition. 

Stat received three more awards after SFTech. It bested entries all around the Philippines as it was named champion for the National Science and Engineering Fair, first runner up during the Social Innovation for Health Initiative, and best research poster in Science and Technology Education center. This also opened a door in my career as a product designer as it captured the heart of a tech company called Symph.

Stat was my first app concept, it taught me the ropes around product design and gave me many awards to be proud of. However, what really made me happy was the discovery of the mother and daughter's safety as they used a live telemedicine app as inspired by Stat.

## One gadget One child

Two months before September, the commencement of Online Distance Learning was announced by the department of education. I was reminded by a classmate as soon as I saw the requirements: a phone and an internet connection. I knew my classmate would handle this well, he was dedicated. The only setback was how he did not have or at least the resources to purchase a phone. 

As soon as I saw One Gadget One Child's first Facebook post, announcing how they are starting an initiative donating gadgets to students. My first reaction was to help, my second reaction was "the graphics could use some work". I was a shy individual, so I could only check and recheck as I make sure I had no typos as I composed a message to the initiative's head. 

One conversion later and I was onboarded to the team consisting of others who volunteered. I was the only graphics designer, so I assumed the role of creating the branding, which eventually turned to me handling the graphics or video for every post from thereon.

It was a meaningful and wholesome experience. Reading the letters written by the recipients made me feel so grateful—thankful that I was about to use my talent this way. As we wrapped up our initiative almost one year later, I could only smile far and wide as I was shown the 70 families who received a gadget. When there is a will, there truly is a way.
