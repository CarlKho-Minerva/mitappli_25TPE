# Life Story

Created: October 16, 2021 11:52 PM

I am living a decent life. I have food on the table and a roof over my head. I am blessed. This comes for a reason: God has given me abundance in life because He wished for me to become His instrument in sharing and being a blessing to others. That is the philosophy I have adapted and adored, one taught by my loving parents.

On the academic side of things, I am that kind of student who loves research and the works. I crave knowledgeâ€”practical ones that aide me in my dreams of becoming a part of the Research and Development team for Emerging Technologies in Google. Because of this pursuit, I have come to love problem solving, especially investigatory projects and innovation-making contests. This has helped me in developing an open mind and a desire for leadership; leading me to not only advance myself, but also guide others to join me in my journey to better the world. As proven by my God-given success in hackathon victories.

Moving forward, I wish to adapt a more humane manner of doing things: helping more, appreciating more, loving more rather than being fixated on the technical side of things. And I think that is what makes me outstanding: being open to change and, inevitably, being able to change; grow for the better.  Be the instrument God wants me to become.
