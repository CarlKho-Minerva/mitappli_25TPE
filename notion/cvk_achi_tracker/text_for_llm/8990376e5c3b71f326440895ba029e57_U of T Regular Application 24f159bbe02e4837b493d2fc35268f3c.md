Diving head-first into a pit full of sharks is an experience I have gotten comfortable with. Except the sharks were competitions like the World Robotics Olympiad (WRO) and Science Investigatory Projects (SIPs)—and I have successfully tamed my sharks, driving me further into success. This unlocked my innate passion for Science and Technology and desire to be a pioneer in life. Initially, my enthusiasm was not immediately met by success: I was responsible for the team who was always last during the WRO trials; I was the "researcher" who copy-paste Wikipedia links in the bibliography of my paper. 

Fast forward in the pandemic setting, where I have turned into a self-driven and multi-awarded problem solver who goes beyond classroom academics and actively seeks hackathons and problems to solve thanks to the 24/7 access to my desktop. These experiences led me to holistically navigate life as a now product designer of Symph, a tech company in Cebu, where I regularly communicate with clients and deliver quality project outputs. All while giving back to my community with One Gadget One Child, where we give gadgets to marginalized students to continue their education. Who knew a band of volunteers could impact the lives of 70 families?

Despite realizing the obstacles an idea has to undergo before actualization—and very rarely, success, I still want to develop new ones and pioneer with them. Let the University of Toronto witness my new dive as I finish Engineering Sciences and become a Research Scientist on Emerging Tech.
