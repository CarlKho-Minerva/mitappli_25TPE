    I take calculated risks and have already accepted the fact that my chances of being accepted as a Pearson scholar are slim but still worth applying to. If ever I will not be awarded the scholarship, I will continue studies in other universities I have applied to with the same course, though U of T is still preferred.
    
    Once I complete my studies, I will still continue on my path to being a research scientist and giving back to the community with the help of initiatives.
    

- **Essay**

    I am known for leading the flag of a small high school in the Philippines to the World Robotics Olympiad in Hungary. However, the challenges behind this success included embarrassing my school by always being in last place, as well as learning a lot of calculus too advanced for my level, then convincing people for financial support. This essay will cover the story of how I led my team to the international stage through years of trial and error with a stroke of bold, last-minute decisions.
    
    My first year in Marigondon National High School (MNHS) also happened to be the time when the school of 5,000 junior high school students received their first Lego EV3 kit. Though I was only a freshman with zero experience, I was delegated to be the team captain and algorithm engineer due to my experience in web development—which was self-taught—and major interest in what I called "learnable robotics". In my first competition, the First Lego League (FLL), I broke down and cried. Then, for the next three years, our robot would continue to be the last placer on the leaderboard.
    
    September 5, 2019. Hoops Dome Arena at Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. I could already foresee our loss in the regular category, so as the team captain, I made a wild decision: I convinced the organizers to switch categories; from the robot obstacle course to robot soccer. We broke down the robot we spent months perfecting, and, with our passion reignited by hope and confidence thanks to experience, rebuilt it to fit a completely new world. We were only given five minutes to build and code on the spot for the new category, as the matches were already starting. We won 3rd place that day and qualified for the nationals.
    
    Long story short, in the nationals, my team was banned from playing until we modified our build. We did not have the appropriate sensors. The parts used in our robots were compromised, since our school was not financially capable enough to provide us with the proper sensor to detect the infrared ball. We, however, carried on with unorthodox methods, utilizing the other sensors allowed in. Like Iron Man making the clunky first version of his suit. Surprisingly, we made it to the semi-finals and represented the Philippines in the WRO 2018 Invitationals. The following year, we continued the same path and thankfully made it to the nationals again. The only difference was the community in Lapu-Lapu lent us parts. We also tapped into an engineer for guidance. He played a significant role in our success by somehow managing to introduce us to the P.I.D. Control System: a self-correcting algorithm, two days before the nationals. I vividly remember the night in Manila before the competition proper: two timid grade 10 students studying a few college-level engineering concepts in hopes of getting into the internationals taking place at Györ, Hungary. During the contest proper, we prayed, played, made a few friends from the Claret School of Quezon, prayed and played with said new friends, then we managed to score a goal—both metaphorically and literally—by getting 3rd place, securing my team a spot in the internationals.
    
    Before the glorious nights in Europe, we were faced with yet another financial dilemma: the money needed to fund our flight and stay in Hungary. We knocked on many doors, hoping for kind hearts to open up. It was a long but rewarding journey. In the end, the mayor of Lapu-Lapu City, Hon. Ahong Chan came to our aid. A core memory that will forever inspire me and my team. As I waved the Philippine flag in glory at the stages of Edutus University, I could not help but be grateful to God, my family, my educators, and myself for not giving up. Cliché, as it may be, failure and experience really are life's greatest teachers. It may be hard, but it is not impossible.

- **Self Letter of Reference**
    
    *The students who are nominated for the Lester B. Pearson International Scholarship are students who have demonstrated exceptional academic achievement and creativity, who are accepted as leaders within their school, and who have the potential to contribute to the global community in the future. They can be distinguished from other students who may have equally high academic results by virtue of their breadth of interest, intellectual energy and impact on the life of their school and community.*
    
    Write a letter of reference for yourself in the third person describing how the applicant (you) meets these criteria. The letter should refer to the specific achievements and experiences. It may also comment on any weaknesses. *(300 word maximum)*
    
    Carl is a self-driven, high-performing student who goes above and beyond in every endeavor. In the last two years, I have witnessed Carl grow from someone who shoulders every workload on his own—because of his high standards—to being a likable leader who gives equal care and attention to his group members.
    
    Even during junior high school, he has proven himself passionate by attending Science Fairs yearly. It is rare to witness the same student voluntarily come back with novel concepts, as research is a task despised by students in his community. It is the same story for Carl's yearly endeavors in the World Robotics Olympiad. His team was at the bottom of the list, but in his final year, he led his team and topped the nationals, representing the Philippines in Hungary.
    
    Outside of academics is where Carl shines the brightest. He garners wisdom by self-studying, then joining one hackathon to another. His telemedicine project "Stat" won multiple awards such as the Philippines' National Science and Engineering Fair. Even during the COVID quarantine, Carl managed develop six celebrated innovations. Because of this, he was called upon by the Philippines' Department of Education and Canada's O'Neill High School to promote practical problem-solving with technology. When Super Typhoon Rai damaged Lapu-Lapu City badly days before Christmas, Carl spent the holidays helping develop a website to locate resources amidst a devastated Cebu while assuming the role of a journalist to amplify the city's call for help.
    
    Carl's personal qualities are also well-honed. To cope with stress, he makes art pieces. To give back to the community, Carl has volunteered in and founded initiatives, namely One Gadget One Child, and Padayun.Ko ("I will continue"), to help with more accessible education. I think Carl is a holistic individual with the potential to better the world's way of life.
    

- **Reflecting on the activities that you have described above, what qualities do you believe that you have developed through your participation in these activities? How do you think they may have helped to prepare you for U of T Engineering? Feel free to comment on how your community engagement may have been different than expected as a result of COVID-19 pandemic.** (250 words or less)
    
    
    Diving head-first into a pit full of sharks is an experience I have gotten comfortable with. Except the sharks were competitions like the World Robotics Olympiad (WRO) and Science Investigatory Projects (SIPs)—and I have successfully tamed my sharks, driving me further into success. This unlocked my innate passion for Science and Technology and desire to be a pioneer in life. Initially, my enthusiasm was not immediately met by success: I was responsible for the team who was always last during the WRO trials; I was the "researcher" who copy-paste Wikipedia links in the bibliography of my paper. 
    
    Fast forward in the pandemic setting, where I have turned into a self-driven and multi-awarded problem solver who goes beyond classroom academics and actively seeks hackathons and problems to solve thanks to the 24/7 access to my desktop. These experiences led me to holistically navigate life as a now product designer of Symph, a tech company in Cebu, where I regularly communicate with clients and deliver quality project outputs. All while giving back to my community with One Gadget One Child, where we give gadgets to marginalized students to continue their education. Who knew a band of volunteers could impact the lives of 70 families?
    
    Despite realizing the obstacles an idea has to undergo before actualization—and very rarely, success, I still want to develop new ones and pioneer with them. Let the University of Toronto witness my new dive as I finish Engineering Sciences and become a Research Scientist on Emerging Tech.
    

- **Academic Objectives** 

Describe your academic objectives and indicate how these are appropriate to your long-range goals. Please include specifically how a Bachelor's degree from the University of Toronto will contribute to your achieving your longer-range goals. (100 word maximum)
    
    
    Becoming a Research Science requires a firm understanding of Scientific Concepts. Studying at the University of Toronto, a world-class institute, will provide me with practical mental models and best practices to properly approach and solve pressing problems. Although research-based companies today like Google hire based on outputs and problem-solving skills, receiving a Bachelor's degree from U of T will help me stand out by exemplifying my dedication. This will be shown through my endeavors like getting into the university as a scholar and an international student, as well as by simply surviving and finishing the notoriously tough engineering course.
