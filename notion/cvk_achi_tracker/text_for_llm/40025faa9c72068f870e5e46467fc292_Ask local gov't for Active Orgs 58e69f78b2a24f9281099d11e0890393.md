Hon. Ahong Chan,

The pandemic has exposed those who have truly served the public in Cebu. From community pantries to initiatives donating gadgets to students. 

With that, I would like to invite Oponganons to help the givers. I am launching a website named Food4Orgs, a public database containing the contact details of active organizations. This was made with the idea that people with extra food can send their meals to our hardworking organizations. Though we can send other items, I would like to emphasize food.

I would like to request a list of active organizations + their contact details in Lapu-Lapu to be part of the first version. I will be personally asking for each of their consent after then. This will also help raise awareness for this initiative.

What do you think of the idea? Is it worthy enough for the LLC Gov't to support this by spreading the word?

Sincerely,

Carl Kho
