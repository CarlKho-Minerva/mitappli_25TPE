I copy-pasted Wikipedia links and placed them under the bibliography section of my 6-page "research paper", I remember crying at the fact that our EV3 robot failed in the First Lego League. These happened back in grade seven, 2016, where I was introduced and spearheaded Marigondon National High School's Science Investigatory Projects (SIPs) under the innovation category and Lego EV3 Robotics. 

Getting to invent a new product, being able to build and code a working robot shaped the person I am today: an aspiring research scientist in emerging technology with plenty of experience under my belt.
