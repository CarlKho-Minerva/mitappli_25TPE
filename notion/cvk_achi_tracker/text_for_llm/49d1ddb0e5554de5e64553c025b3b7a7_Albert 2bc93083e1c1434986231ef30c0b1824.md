**Hi Kuya Albert! Since you're familiar with starting initiatives (the rice movement/1G1C), I would like to validate my idea for a potential one.**

My mother receives reimbursable money for food everytime she has a webinar. Tungod ana, nanambok me. Hahaha!

I proposed an idea nga what if we commit to using 50% of the money to giving back sa community in the means of food (from Grab, FoodPanda, etc.). Our first receipients today are our subdivision's security guards.

**With that, I would like to create an excel file (will notion this later) containing the the addresses of organizations who are helping Lapu-Lapu City, so that we may also be able to deliver food for them.**

TABLE FORMAT

```
Org name | What they do | Address
```

The idea I would like to emphasize here is that we could order food for them as well. I know it has potential to be more than food, but I want to give the donors the perception of the task being "easily-done". 

As of now, it's just a table of information. I wont be using anything else yet to hasten the process, but I think the idea of being able to know who's worthy to give is decent on its own.

**Can I have your thoughts on this?**

P.S No name yet. Just a thought I had 20 minutes ago during shower after preparing for the delivery.
