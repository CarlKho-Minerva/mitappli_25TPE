# CV Content Brainstorm Summary

**Date:** November 1, 2025
**Status:** Planning Phase Complete ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ What We Found

### Your Content is RICH but SCATTERED:

**The Good News:**
- You have 245+ documented achievements
- 50+ published technical/design articles
- 20+ hackathon participations with multiple wins ($25k+ in prizes)
- Voice transcripts capturing recent projects in detail
- Professional LinkedIn/portfolio exports
- Media features from reputable sources

**The Challenge:**
- Content lives in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, PDF, TXT)
- Voice notes are stream-of-consciousness (authentic but needs structuring)
- No single source of truth
- Hard to update consistently

---

## üí° The Strategy: Markdown-First CV System

### Why This Approach Works for You:

1. **You're already using VS Code + Markdown** (from your voice notes)
2. **Copilot-friendly** - Your "LLM-friendly blog folio" philosophy
3. **Version controlled** - Git tracks every change
4. **Multi-format export** - One source ‚Üí PDF resume, HTML portfolio, JSON API
5. **Update via voice** - Whisper transcription ‚Üí quick markdown edits

## üìÅ Proposed Structure (11 Main Categories)

```
00-PROFILE          ‚Üí Bio, contact, elevator pitch
01-EDUCATION        ‚Üí Minerva, STEC, certifications

5. **Switched from Notion to Markdown/VS Code** - Shows technical sophistication.

6. **Teaching while being taught** - TA while still an undergrad shows trust from faculty.

7. **Featured in Cebu Daily News at 16** - Early recognition for WRO/mapping.

8. **50+ published articles** - That's a BOOK worth of content.

## ü§î Open Questions for You

Before we proceed, consider:

1. **Primary Use Case:** Is this for MIT Media Lab app, job hunting, or general portfolio?

2. **Public vs Private:** What should be public (GitHub, portfolio site) vs private (full archive)?

3. **Update Frequency:** Daily quick captures? Weekly reviews? Monthly deep updates?

4. **Visual Style:** Clean minimal? Pixel aesthetic from your Webflow days? Interactive?

5. **Content Priority:** Focus on recent work (2024-2025) or comprehensive history?

6. **Automation Level:** How much do you want automated vs manual curation?

---

## üé¨ Ready to Start?

**The beautiful thing:** You don't need to process everything at once.

**Start here:**
1. Create the 11-folder structure
2. Extract your top 8 projects from voice notes
3. Build one project markdown file using the template
4. Generate a 2-page resume from that

**Then iterate:**
- Add one achievement per day
- Process one Medium article per week
- Build automation tools as you need them

**Remember:** Your "Discover Shortcuts" philosophy applies here too.
Don't manually process 245 achievements. Build the tools. Let AI help.
Make it sustainable.
