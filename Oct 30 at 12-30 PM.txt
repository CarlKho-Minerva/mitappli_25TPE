Okay so the name of the MyApp was CountOnMe for GDC. Man my volume was so low earlier. Okay I talked about a quick summary of everything that I've made for Argentina. Which was our alt projects and that was the HSC Feedback tool. That's the RPG Hierarchical To-Do List. That's the NeoBite Detector with Wear OS. that's the Uber data exploratory data processing, statistical analysis, and a couple of projects for a university in Argentina called Universidad Interamericana something with UAI in Argentina. When I made a couple of things, one was an exploration of creating a PID control system with an Arduino portentum with a camera module and I also made a remote LED app that could just take advantage of the wireless control system. There was also a robot League Procter, which during the competition of a virtual program was the simulation, there was a robotics simulation competition, which when the competition it tracks everything and it sort of warns the propters if there's something suspicious going on. That's that and for an additional category for my portfolio certification is then there is my agent and my certificate. And of course there's the scholarship tool.
