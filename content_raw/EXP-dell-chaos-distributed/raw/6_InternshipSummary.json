I\u0027m focusing on analyzing the first two screenshots, identifying the key actions, involved individuals, and any relevant files or links. My primary task is to extract pertinent information about a service issue and my troubleshooting steps, including deleting a namespace to resolve the problem.\n\n\n**Documenting the Interactions**\n\nI\u0027m now in the process of extracting the critical details from the first four screenshots of batch 4, and documenting them following the established format. So far, I\u0027ve logged the initial query to Guo, Lin, regarding the service issue and the verbose output requested. I\u0027ve also noted the discussion about the `-s` flag in the curl command.

Yesenia is preparing Confluence documentation, and we will now concentrate on implementing a specific 503 error return.\n\n\n**Reviewing the Injection Demonstration**\n\nI\u0027ve documented sharing the video and confirmed that the team received it.

I shared my `kubectl` and `curl` commands. I also added context that a previous issue (being unable to delete existing experiments) was resolved by force-deleting a namespace that was stuck in the \"Terminating\" state by removing its finalizers.\n*   **People:** Guo, Lin\n*   **Files:** None\n*   **Links:** None\n*   **Next:** Troubleshoot the `infraaos` connection with Guo, Lin.\n\n**Monday, July 7, 2025, 12:05 PM**\n*   **Action:** Per Guo, Lin\u0027s request, I re-ran my `curl` command with the `-vvv` flag for verbose output and shared the results.\n*   **People:** Guo, Lin\n*   **Files:** None\n*   **Links:** None\n*   **Next:** Await analysis of the verbose log from Guo, Lin.\n\n**Monday, July 7, 2025, 1:16 PM**\n*   **Action:** Responded to Guo, Lin\u0027s question about using `curl -s` (silent mode), explaining that I used it to hide the progress bar which I found distracting.\n*   **People:** Guo, Lin\n*   **Files:** None\n*   **Links:** None\n*   **Next:** Follow Guo, Lin\u0027s guidance on using command flags.\n\n**Monday, July 7, 2025, 1:23 PM**\n*   **Action:** Following Guo, Lin\u0027s advice, I removed the `-s` flag for debugging. I then shared the new `OpenSSL SSL_connect` error that appeared.\n*   **People:** Guo, Lin\n*   **Files:** None\n*   **Links:** None\n*   **Next:** Work with Guo, Lin to solve the new SSL error.\n\n**Monday, July 7, 2025, 1:28 PM**\n*   **Action:** Acknowledged a simple but critical typo pointed out by Guo, Lin: I was using `https` instead of `http` in the URL. After correcting it, I confirmed the command was now successful, returning a `202 Accepted` status.\n*   **People:** Guo, Lin\n*   **Files:** None\n*   **Links:** None\n*   **Next:** The connection issue is resolved. Proceed with fault injection testing.\n\n**Monday, July 7, 2025, 1:50 PM**\n*   **Action:** Provided a status update on a new problem. After fixing the namespace issue, we were now facing a `expected docker:// but got containerd://` error. I noted that the original namespace deletion had stalled for over two hours, necessitating the forceful removal.\n*   **People:** Team (May, Alexander; Guo, Lin; Hernandez, Yesenia)\n*   **Files:** None\n*   **Links:** None\n*   **Next:** Continue investigating the `containerd` issue and provide updates.\n\n**Monday, July 7, 2025, 2:01 PM**\n*   **Action:** Successfully injected a fault into the system.

I also provided context that this work was previously blocked by a namespace error.\n*   **People:** Team (May, Alexander; Guo, Lin; Hernandez, Yesenia)\n*   **Files:** None\n*   **Links:** None\n*   **Next:** The next step is to make the API return a specific 503 error message.\n\n**Monday, July 7, 2025, 2:18 PM**\n*   **Action:** Participated in a meeting where progress was discussed. May, Alexander summarized that Yesenia and I would focus on automating the fault injection steps into a Python script once they are fully confirmed.\n*   **People:** May, Alexander; Hernandez, Yesenia; Guo, Lin; Myself (Carl Vincent Ladres)\n*   **Files:** None\n*   **Links:** None\n*   **Decision:** The team decided to automate the manual steps via a Python script. Yesenia’s idea to use Grafana + Prometheus for visualization was approved as a future enhancement.\n\n**Monday, July 7, 2025, 2:26 PM**\n*   **Action:** Shared a video recording of the successful fault injection process for the team\u0027s reference.\n*   **People:** May, Alexander; Guo, Lin; Hernandez, Yesenia\n*   **Files:** `3_Successful_503-abort_070725.mkv`\n*   **Links:** None\n*   **Next:** The video will serve as a reference for the team and for future documentation.\n\n**Monday, July 7, 2025, 2:27 PM**\n*   **Action:** Received confirmation from Yesenia that she would create Confluence documentation for the process.\n*   **People:** Hernandez, Yesenia\n*   **Files:** None\n*   **Links:** None\n*   **Next:** Yesenia will create and share the Confluence documentation.\n\n**Tuesday, July 8, 2025, 9:46 AM**\n*   **Action:** Confirmed that the node `enter-maint`/`exit-maint` and deletion functionalities were working as expected.\n*   **People:** Team\n*   **Files:** None\n*   **Links:** None\n*   **Next:** I will now focus on the next implementation goal: making the API return a specific 503 error message.\n\n**Tuesday, July 8, 2025, 11:11 AM**\n*   **Action:** In response to Guo, Lin, Yesenia confirmed that she and I would be ready to present our updates at the Thursday evening CNOS meeting.\n*   **People:** Guo, Lin; Hernandez, Yesenia; Myself (Carl Vincent Ladres)\n*   **Files:** None\n*   **Links:** None\n*   **Next:** Yesenia and I will prepare presentation slides for the Thursday meeting.\n\n**Monday, August 4, 2025**\n*   **Action:** Began preparing for the final presentation. I asked for feedback on the Executive Summary, specifically about which customers to mention (e.g., Wells Fargo) and how to articulate the project\u0027s value to Dell more specifically.\n*   **People:** Seelam, Karunakara; Le, Dave\n*   **Files:** `Juan 1to1 Presentation Feedback.mkv`, an embedded screenshot of the \"Executive Summary\" slide.\n*   **Links:** None\n*   **Next:** Await feedback from senior team members to refine the presentation content.\n\n**Monday, August 4, 2025, 9:00 PM**\n*   **Action:** Received and acknowledged feedback on the presentation.
