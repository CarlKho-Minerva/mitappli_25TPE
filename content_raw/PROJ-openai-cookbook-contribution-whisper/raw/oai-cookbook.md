Example code and guides for accomplishing common tasks with the OpenAI API. To run these examples, you'll need an OpenAI account and associated API key (create a free account here). Set an environment variable called OPENAI_API_KEY with your API key. Alternatively, in most IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, you can create an .env file at the root of your repo containing OPENAI_API_KEY=<your API key>, which will be picked up by the notebooks.

Most code examples are written in Python, though the concepts can be applied in any language.

For other useful tools, guides and courses, check out these related resources from around the web.
