- **Represented the Philippines as Captain of the RoboSoccer team at the World Robotics Olympiad 2019 at Hungary after besting 7 national teams with the proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller.**

    8/2018 - 9/2019

    I participated in the World Robotics Olympiad (WRO) for four consecutive years as team captain and an algorithm engineer in Robot Soccer. Before that, I had to learn self-correcting algorithms, such as the proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller on my own while championing my team through the Lapu-Lapu division level against three teams, then the nationals: where we won 3rd of the eight participating schools nationwide. We represented the Philippines on the WRO-2018 Invitationals and placed 10th; on WRO-2019 and placed 6th in our bracket.
