# Financials Follow up | @October 25, 2024

Okay, after presenting your Lean Canvas, focus on a clear, concise, and data-driven financial narrative that demonstrates the potential for growth and return on investment. Here's a structured approach with example calculations (remember to replace these with your own researched data and pricing):

**1. Market Size and Target Audience:**

"We're targeting the over 10.3 million junior and senior high school students in the Philippines. This represents a substantial market actively seeking educational opportunities and financial aid for higher education."

**2. Penetration Rate and User Projections:**

"We project a conservative 2% market penetration in Year 1, reaching 206,000 students. We anticipate increasing this to 5% in Year 2 (515,000 students) and 10% in Year 3 (1,030,000 students). These projections are based on our targeted marketing efforts, strategic partnerships, and the growing demand for accessible scholarship information."

**3. Revenue Model and Projections:**

- **Freemium Model (B2C):** "Our freemium model offers core features for free. We project a 5% conversion rate to our premium subscription priced at ₱1,000/year (approx. $18 USD). This translates to ₱10.3M ($185,400 USD) in Year 1, ₱25.75M ($463,500 USD) in Year 2, and ₱51.5M ($927,000 USD) in Year 3 from B2C revenue."
- **School Subscriptions (B2B):** "For schools, we offer tiered subscriptions starting at ₱50,000/year for up to 500 students. With approximately 60,000 schools in the Philippines, capturing just 1% in Year 1 (600 schools) generates ₱30M ($540,000 USD). We aim to increase this to 2% and 3% in subsequent years, yielding ₱60M and ₱90M respectively."
- **Government Contracts (B2G):** "While harder to quantify initially, we are actively pursuing government partnerships, which we anticipate will contribute significantly to revenue in later years."

      `# Year 1 Revenue Calculation Example
b2c_users_year1 = 206000
b2c_conversion_rate = 0.05
b2c_price = 1000
b2c_revenue_year1 = b2c_users_year1 * b2c_conversion_rate * b2c_price
print(f'B2C Revenue Year 1: ₱{b2c_revenue_year1:,}')

b2b_schools_year1 = 600
b2b_price = 50000
b2b_revenue_year1 = b2b_schools_year1 * b2b_price
print(f'B2B Revenue Year 1: ₱{b2b_revenue_year1:,}')

total_revenue_year1 = b2c_revenue_year1 + b2b_revenue_year1
print(f'Total Revenue Year 1: ₱{total_revenue_year1:,}')`

**4. Cost Structure:**

"Our primary costs include cloud computing, team salaries (marketing, database maintenance, development), content creation, and outreach expenses. We estimate total operating costs of ₱15M ($270,000 USD) in Year 1, scaling proportionally with user growth in subsequent years."

**5. Key Takeaways & Scalability:**

"Our lean, scalable model allows us to reach a large market efficiently. The freemium model drives user acquisition, while school subscriptions and government contracts provide substantial revenue streams. Our strong value proposition and first-mover advantage position us for rapid growth in the underserved Filipino education market. We are confident in achieving profitability within [ timeframe ] and generating significant social impact by empowering students to access higher education."

This structured approach, combining market data, clear revenue projections, and cost estimates, creates a compelling financial narrative that is easy to understand and instills confidence in your audience. Remember to adjust the numbers and assumptions based on your specific research and market analysis.

Let's calculate the potential revenue based on your Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM), using the provided student and school numbers and the pricing structure from the previous response.

**1. Total Addressable Market (TAM):**

- **Students:** 13,234,374 (Elementary) + 7,011,942 (Junior High) + 3,317,973 (Senior High) = 23,564,289 students
- **Schools:** 60,000 schools

**TAM Revenue Potential (Hypothetical Maximum):**

- **B2C (if all students subscribed to Premium):** 23,564,289 students * ₱1,000/year = ₱23,564,289,000
- **B2B (if all schools subscribed to Tier 3):** 60,000 schools * ₱120,000/year = ₱7,200,000,000

**Total TAM Revenue Potential (B2C + B2B):** ₱30,764,289,000

**2. Serviceable Available Market (SAM):**

- **Students:** 7,011,942 (Junior High) + 3,317,973 (Senior High) = 10,329,915 students
- **Schools:** 60,000 schools (same as TAM, as we're considering all schools for B2B)

**SAM Revenue Potential (More Realistic):**

Let's assume a hypothetical market penetration rate for SAM:

- **B2C:** 5% of SAM students subscribe to Premium: 10,329,915 students * 0.05 * ₱1,000/year = ₱516,495,750
- **B2B:** 5% of SAM schools subscribe to Tier 3: 60,000 schools * 0.05 * ₱120,000/year = ₱360,000,000

**Total SAM Revenue Potential (B2C + B2B):** ₱876,495,750

**3. Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):**

This is your current target market, and the revenue calculations are the same as provided earlier, using your projected penetration rates:

- **Year 1:** ₱40,300,000 (B2C + B2B)
- **Year 2:** (You'll need to provide projected Year 2 user numbers for precise calculations)
- **Year 3:** (You'll need to provide projected Year 3 user numbers for precise calculations)

**Key Takeaways:**

- **TAM:** Represents the theoretical maximum revenue if you captured the entire market. It's useful for understanding the overall market size but isn't a practical target in the short term.
- **SAM:** A more realistic market segment that you can potentially serve. The revenue potential here is more achievable but still requires significant market penetration.
- **SOM:** Your immediate target market. Your focus should be on achieving strong growth within your SOM, then expanding to reach your SAM.

By presenting these figures, you can demonstrate the significant potential for growth and scalability of your platform. It's essential to highlight your strategy for moving from your SOM to SAM and eventually towards your TAM. Remember to update these calculations with your own projections and market research for a more accurate and compelling financial narrative.
