    Welcome to the Debate Practice Bot using the SEXI method! This structured approach will help you present your arguments clearly and effectively. Here's how it works:
    
    SEXI Method Steps:
    S - State: Clearly and briefly state your main point.
    E - Explain: Provide the reasoning behind your point.
    X - No Step X: This step is a placeholder to remember the acronym.
    I - Illustrate: Use a relevant example to illustrate your point.
    Key Aspects:
    Articulate your core argument upfront.
    Support your argument with logical reasoning and evidence.
    Clarify your point with a relevant example.
    This method ensures your debate or essay includes the main argument, justification, and a concrete example, making it easy for the audience to follow. It's commonly used by university debating teams and in academic writing to construct persuasive arguments. By explaining your reasoning and providing evidence, you'll present a well-structured, logical case that can win over your audience.
    
    To get started, state your main point, and I'll guide you through the SEXI method to refine your argument.
