    ### Summary of Competitive Landscape
    
    The competitive landscape shows that while there are several platforms available, each has unique features tailored to different aspects of the scholarship application process. The primary differentiation lies in the added value services such as personalized coaching or comprehensive tracking tools. Pricing strategies vary from freemium models to subscription-based services targeting educational institutions.
    
    ## Pricing Research for B2B SaaS Platforms in Education
    
    ### Pricing Strategies
    
    1. **Value-Based Pricing**
        - This strategy sets prices based on the perceived value to customers rather than the cost of production or competitor pricing. Successful examples include:
            - **Adobe:** Charges premium prices for its Creative Cloud suite due to the high value it provides to creative professionals.
            - **Coursera:** Offers courses at varying price points based on the value they provide to learners, especially in professional development contexts.
    2. **Tiered Pricing**
        - Many SaaS products use tiered pricing to cater to different customer segments:
            - For example, platforms like **QuickBooks** offer different plans based on features needed by small businesses versus larger enterprises, allowing flexibility in pricing based on usage.
    3. **Performance-Based Metrics**
        - Some EdTech companies implement performance-based pricing where fees are tied to measurable outcomes:
            - For instance, companies may charge schools based on the number of scholarships awarded through their platform or improvements in student performance metrics.
    
    ### Recommendations for Padayon Ko
    
    Given these insights, Padayon Ko could adopt a hybrid pricing model combining value-based and performance-based strategies, offering tiered subscriptions aligned with the number of students served and tying additional fees to measurable outcomes such as scholarship dollars awarded.
    
    ## Partnership Opportunities: Major Scholarship Providers in the Philippines
    
    ### Government Agencies
    
    1. **Commission on Higher Education (CHED)**

    2. **Department of Science and Technology (DOST)**
        - Provides scholarships focused on STEM fields through its Science Education Institute (DOST-SEI).
    3. **Department of Health (DOH)**
        - Offers scholarships for students pursuing medical and allied health courses, often requiring service commitments post-graduation.
    
    ### Private Foundations
    
    1. **LANDBANK Scholarship Program**
        - Aimed at deserving students from poorer provinces, offering full tuition and living stipends.
    2. **Megaworld Foundation Scholarship**
        - Provides full tuition and allowances while encouraging volunteerism among scholars.
    3. **SM Foundation College Scholarship**

- October 20, 2024 | Potential Market â€” Quantified
    
    To effectively present your business model for Padayon Ko and quantify your potential market, we can analyze the Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) based on current statistics regarding student enrollment, school demographics, and the competitive landscape in the Philippines.
    
    ## Total Addressable Market (TAM)
    
    ### Student Enrollment Data
    
    - For the School Year 2024-2025, there are **23.85 million students** enrolled across various educational levels in the Philippines:
        - **Elementary:** 13,234,374 students
        - **Junior High School:** 7,011,942 students
        - **Senior High School:** 3,317,973 students[2].
    
    Given that Padayon Ko targets high school students aspiring to pursue college education, we can focus on the senior high school segment for initial TAM calculations.
    
    - **Senior High School Enrollment:** Approximately **3.32 million students**.
    
    ### Schools in the Philippines
    
    - 60,000 public and private schools in the Philippines. This includes elementary, junior high schools, and senior high schools[1].
    
    If we assume that each school could potentially benefit from Padayon Ko's platform to assist their students in securing scholarships, our TAM can be calculated as follows:
    
    - **TAM Calculation:**
        - Total Schools: **60,000**
        - Average number of students per school: Assuming an average of 500 students per school leads to a potential reach of:
        $$ \text{TAM} = 60,000 \text{ schools} \times 500 \text{ students/school} = 30,000,000 \text{ potential users} $$
    
    ## Serviceable Available Market (SAM)
    
    ### Targeting Senior High Schools
    
    Focusing specifically on senior high schools:
    
    - Assuming there are about **15,000 senior high schools** in the Philippines[2].
    
    If we maintain the previous assumption of an average of **500 students per school**, we can calculate:
    
    - **SAM Calculation:**
        - Total Senior High Schools: **15,000**
        - Average number of students per senior high school:
        $$ \text{SAM} = 15,000 \text{ schools} \times 500 \text{ students/school} = 7,500,000 \text{ potential users} $$
    
    ## Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
    
    ### Realistic Market Penetration
    
    To estimate SOM, we can consider a more conservative market penetration rate. Assuming Padayon Ko aims to capture about **5%** of the SAM in its initial years:
    
    - **SOM Calculation:**
    $$ \text{SOM} = 7,500,000 \text{ potential users} \times 0.05 = 375,000 \text{ users} $$
    
    ## Revenue Projections
    
    ### Pricing Model
    
    Assuming a tiered subscription fee structure for schools based on the number of users:
    
    1. **Basic Tier:** $500/year for up to 100 students.
    2. **Standard Tier:** $1,000/year for up to 300 students.
    3. **Premium Tier:** $2,500/year for up to 1,000 students.
    
    If we estimate that out of the projected SOM of **375,000 users**, approximately:
    
    - **50%** will subscribe to the Basic Tier,
    - **30%** to the Standard Tier,
    - **20%** to the Premium Tier,
    
    We can calculate revenue as follows:
    
    1. Basic Tier Revenue:
    $$
    \text{Basic Tier Users} = 375,000 \times 0.50 = 187,500
    $$
    $$
    \text{Revenue} = \frac{187,500}{100} \times \$500 = \$937,500
    $$
    2. Standard Tier Revenue:
    $$
    \text{Standard Tier Users} = 375,000 \times 0.30 = 112,500
    $$
    $$
    \text{Revenue} = \frac{112,500}{300} \times \$1,000 = \$375,000
    $$
    3. Premium Tier Revenue:
    $$
    \text{Premium Tier Users} = 375,000 \times 0.20 = 75,000
    $$
    $$
    \text{Revenue} = \frac{75,000}{1000} \times \$2,500 = \$187,500
    $$
    
    ### Total Revenue Projection
    
    Combining all tiers yields:
    $$
    \text{Total Revenue} = \$937,500 + \$375,000 + \$187,500 = \$1,500,000
    $$
    
    ## Conclusion
    
    With these metrics and projections in handâ€”TAM at approximately **30 million**, SAM at about **7.5 million**, and a realistic SOM of around **375 thousand users**â€”you can confidently present a compelling case to investors regarding Padayon Ko's growth potential and revenue generation capabilities within the Philippine education sector.

- October 20, 2024 | B2B + B2C Crunching Numbers
    
    To effectively present a hybrid business model for Padayon Ko that incorporates both B2B and B2C elements, we can refine the TAM, SAM, and SOM calculations while considering the influence of parents in the education sector. This approach will provide a comprehensive view that investors can easily digest.
    
    ## Total Addressable Market (TAM)
    
    ### Student and Parent Market
    
    1. **Total Students in Senior High Schools:**
        - Approximately **3.32 million** students are enrolled in senior high schools in the Philippines.
    2. **Total Schools:**
        - There are around **15,000 senior high schools** in the Philippines.
    3. **Parent Engagement:**
        - Assuming an average of **1.5 children per parent**, and that **70%** of parents engage with the platform:
        - Total number of parents engaging with the platform can be estimated as:
        $$
        \text{Parents} = 3,320,000 \times 0.7 \times 1.5 = 3,492,000
        $$
    4. **Total Potential Users (Students + Parents):**
        - Combining students and parents gives us:
        $$
        \text{TAM} = 3,320,000 + 3,492,000 = 6,812,000
        $$
    
    ## Serviceable Available Market (SAM)
    
    ### Targeting Schools and Parents
    
    1. **B2B Market (Schools):**
        - The SAM for schools remains at approximately **7.5 million** users (from previous calculations).
    2. **B2C Market (Parents):**
        - The number of parents engaging with the platform is estimated at **3,492,000**.
    3. **Total SAM Calculation:**
    $$
    \text{SAM} = \text{B2B Users} + \text{B2C Users} = 7,500,000 + 3,492,000 = 10,992,000
    $$
    
    ## Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
    
    ### Realistic Market Penetration
    
    Assuming a conservative market penetration rate of **5%** for initial phases:
    
    $$
    \text{SOM} = 10,992,000 \times 0.05 = 549,600
    $$
    
    ## Revenue Projections
    
    ### Pricing Model
    
    Assuming a tiered subscription fee structure for both B2B and B2C components:
    
    1. **B2B Subscription Fees:**
        - Basic Tier: $500/year for up to 100 students.
        - Standard Tier: $1,000/year for up to 300 students.
        - Premium Tier: $2,500/year for up to 1,000 students.
    
    Assuming distribution among tiers remains the same as before:
    
    - Basic Tier: **50%**
    - Standard Tier: **30%**
    - Premium Tier: **20%**
    
    ### B2C Revenue Model
    
    For B2C users (parents), assuming a subscription fee of $50/year per parent:
    
    - Total B2C Users from SOM:
    $$
    \text{B2C SOM} = 549,600 \times 0.70 = 384,720 \text{ parents}
    $$
    - Revenue from B2C:
    $$
    \text{B2C Revenue} = 384,720 \times \$50 = \$19,236,000
    $$
    
    ### Total Revenue Projection
    
    1. **B2B Revenue Calculation:**
        - Basic Tier Revenue:
        $$
        \text{Basic Tier Users} = 549,600 \times 0.50 = 274,800
        $$
        $$
        \text{Revenue} = \frac{274800}{100} \times \$500 = \$1,374,000
        $$
        - Standard Tier Revenue:
        $$
        \text{Standard Tier Users} = 549,600 \times 0.30 = 164,880
        $$
        $$
        \text{Revenue} = \frac{164880}{300} \times \$1,000 = \$549,600
        $$
        - Premium Tier Revenue:
        $$
        \text{Premium Tier Users} = 549,600 \times 0.20 = 109,920
        $$
        $$
        \text{Revenue} = \frac{109920}{1000} \times \$2,500 = \$274,800
        $$
    
    ### Total B2B Revenue
    
    Combining all tiers yields:
    $$
    \text{Total B2B Revenue} = \$1,374,000 + \$549,600 + \$274,800 = \$2,198,400
    $$
    
    ### Final Total Revenue
    
    Combining both B2B and B2C revenues gives us:
    $$
    \text{Total Revenue} = \$19,236,000 + \$2,198,400 = \$21,434,400
    $$
    
    ## Conclusion
    
    Incorporating both B2B and B2C elements into Padayon Ko's business model significantly enhances its market potential:
    
    - **TAM:** Approximately **6.81 million** potential users.
    - **SAM:** About **10.99 million** users.
    - **SOM:** Estimated at around **549,600** users.
    - **Projected Total Revenue:** Approximately **$21.43 million** annually.
    
    This dual approach not only broadens the reach but also leverages parental engagement to drive word-of-mouth marketingâ€”an essential factor in education-related decisionsâ€”making it an attractive proposition for investors looking for scalable growth opportunities in the EdTech sector.

- October 20, 2024 | EMail to Pat about one-pager strategy
    
    Hi Pat,
    
    Iâ€™m really excited about the upcoming pitch! I wanted to reach out to ask for your help:
    
    Firstly, can I please askÂ youÂ to
    
    **print one-pagers for me?**
    
    I plan to give one to each judge. For transparency, the one-pager will outline my lean business canvas and include three key questions for the judges to fill in, which would promote active participation and keep them engaged.Â I believe having all the information at a glance will help facilitate a smoother discussion during my presentation and question-asking after.
    
    I will send the PDF of said one-pagers later this week.
    
    Additionally, since It would be 2:10 AM for me, I would really appreciate it if I could be scheduled toÂ **present first**. I want to ensure that Iâ€™m at my best and avoid any potential brain fog or fatigue that can come later/
    
    Thank you so much for considering my requests! I truly appreciate your support and guidance. Looking forward to seeing you soonâ€”just six days away!
    
    Best regards,
    
    Carl
