**Kabaw - The Math Tutor AI (INTRINSIC MOTIVATION)**

1.	**Feature/Flow Description**

•	**Overview**: The Math Tutor AI is designed to help users become proficient in mathematics by aligning questions with their field of interest. The AI provides tailored math problems and guidance, enhancing learning through practical applications related to the user’s chosen area.

•	**Objective**: To offer personalized math practice and support based on the user’s interests and proficiency level, while also providing tools and visual aids to facilitate understanding.

2.	**User Interaction**

•	**Entry Point**: Users access the Math Tutor AI through a dedicated section where they specify their field of interest and math level.

•	**Steps**:

1.	**Interest and Level Input**:

•	**Field of Interest**: Users indicate their area of interest (e.g., dentistry, business).

•	**Math Level**: Users select the desired level of difficulty (e.g., business math, advanced problem-solving).

2.	**Question Generation**:

•	**Initial Question**: Based on user input, the AI generates a math question relevant to the chosen field and level.

•	**Difficulty Adjustment**: Users can request harder or easier questions based on their preference.

3.	**Problem Solving**:

•	**Guidance**: The AI provides step-by-step guidance without giving direct answers, encouraging users to solve problems independently.

•	**Visual Aids**: Generates images and diagrams to help users visualize mathematical concepts.

•	**Helper Components**: Tools for calculations, code execution, and sketching are available within the interface to assist users.

4.	**Feedback and Engagement**:

•	**Engagement**: The AI prompts users to think critically by asking follow-up questions and ensuring they understand the problem.

•	**Code Execution**: Uses Gemini 1.5 Pro and Python to validate numerical answers internally before providing feedback.

3.	**Technical Implementation**

•	**Technologies Used**: Gemini 1.5 Pro Model, Python (for code execution), X-Cali-Draw (for visual aids), Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (frontend).

•	**Process Flow**:

1.	**Input Collection**: Users provide their field of interest and math level.

2.	**Question Generation**: AI generates and adjusts math questions based on user input.

3.	**Guidance and Aids**: Provides step-by-step solutions, visual aids, and helper tools.

4.	**Feedback Mechanism**: Engages users with iterative questioning and validates answers using code execution.

4.	**User Benefits**
