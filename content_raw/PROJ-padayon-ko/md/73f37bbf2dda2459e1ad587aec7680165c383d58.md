1. Felt like a failure. Coping mechanism? Apply to every scholarship possible
2. Problem was, no database. Not like us where commonapp.
3. So I made one. Realizing that others might need it as well. 
4. Eventually turned into an initiative that the student government adapted. It lives to this day. 
5. One day, someone messaged my initiative and told me about a university
6. Lo and behold, accepted to the most innovative University with the lowest acceptance rate.
7. Financial aid, but even then, the first few words that came out of my dad's mouth was: sorry, but we can't afford this.
8. Coping mechanism again, and I made a website and the mayor took notice to it along with a letter and helped me attend.
9. Kind of a slippery slope, but when I was in the us, got time square because of a scholarship.
10. Proud to introduce myself once againCarl 
    1. CS & AI
        1. Minor Neuropsychology
    2. and I study in seven different countries
