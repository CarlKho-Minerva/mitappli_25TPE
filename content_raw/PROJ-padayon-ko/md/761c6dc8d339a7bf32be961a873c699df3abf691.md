    Did you know that 3.3 million Filipino high school students give up on college every year because they can’t afford it? Instead, they go straight into the workforce to support their families. That’s why I created **Padayan Ko**—a platform designed to help these students secure scholarships from start to finish.
    
    **[00:12]**
    
    As a product of scholarships myself, I know the transformative power they hold. I’m currently studying across seven countries with Minerva University, thanks to a scholarship that changed my life. Now, I’m giving back to my Filipino community.
    
    **[00:24]**
    
    **Padayan Ko** uses Google Gemini to help students build profiles, generate personalized essays, and track achievements. One of our standout features is the **Achievement Tracker**, where students input their accomplishments, and the AI converts them into impressive, ready-to-submit scholarship bullet points. Then there’s our **Super Essays** tool that builds on foundational essays, tailoring them to new application questions with AI assistance—whether you type or speak your input.
    
    **[00:41]**
    
    We also offer an AI-powered math tutor called **Mathy You**, which aligns math questions with students’ personal interests, making preparation for SATs or entrance exams more engaging. Plus, **Fluent**, our voice-only English practice tool, helps students practice speaking for interviews and networking opportunities.
    
    **[00:50]**
    
    Although our MVP is currently live on Notion, we plan to evolve it into a **B2B SaaS platform** where schools can pay a fixed subscription fee to offer Padayan Ko’s tools to their students. This model will allow schools to enhance their student success rates while positioning themselves as leaders in providing global opportunities. By connecting students with international scholarships, schools can also expand their reputation and impact beyond local borders, helping more students tap into life-changing opportunities.
    
    **[01:04]**
    
    At its heart, **Padayan Ko** is about unlocking doors for Filipino students while building a sustainable, scalable business that empowers schools across the country. Who knows? The next Nobel Prize winner could be just one scholarship away. Thank you.

    Our AI is a friend you can talk to about your achievements. It uses your experiences to track your wins and personalize essays, it then leverages these two in my favorite feature: **Super Essays.**
