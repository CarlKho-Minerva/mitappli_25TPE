## **JUDGING ROUND aka points to address**

*Submissions will be evaluated by Google judges who excel in the following five (5) categories as they relate to this challenge: impact, remarkability, creativity, usefulness, and execution. Each criteria will be scored on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The judging criteria is as follows:*

- **Category 1: Impact**
- **Category 2: Remarkability**
- **Category 3: Creativity**
- **Category 4: Usefulness**
- **Category 5: Execution**

*Maximum score: 65*

*In the event of a tie(s), Sponsor will rejudge the Submissions for overall video impact to determine the applicable winner. Sponsor’s decisions are final and binding.*

Using the results of the Judging Criteria score, Sponsor will select **eleven (11) potential winners** as confirmed winners who will be eligible to receive a Prize (defined in “Prizes” section below) (collectively, the “Confirmed Winners”).
