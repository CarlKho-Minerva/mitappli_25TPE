Mic test, mic test, hello. Okay. I'm going to be working backwards and answering questions for my Google Gemini API entry, which is a scholarship repository with an AI suite. I'm not convinced with that. So it sounds too complex. TikTok for a scholarship sounds bad, but it's an end-to-end product from start to finish. It helps you get a scholarship from start to finish. Yeah, I think that has a better touch to it. So I'm building the download code. A scholarship application platform. There you go. A platform that helps you get scholarships from start to finish. Yeah, from start to finish. And if I can brief this data, the idea is at its core, a diagonal helps equalize privilege. That's too big. It broadcasts information or... I could either go the farmer's kid route and how it changed their life, or I can talk about my route at Times Square, but that would sound a bit too biased. So at its core, a diagonal is a list of scholarships. Diagonal is a list of scholarships for Filipinos. Reduces the barrier to entry. So it reduces the barrier to entry for scholarships for both the privileged and underprivileged Filipinos. And how it does that is that it has one, a website that tells you what scholarship is available, is open right now, what you need to apply for the scholarship, how to navigate the website, and... Okay. Like specifically the link to the website, an overview of the scholarship, qualifications, what are the eligibility requirements, document requirements, like legal docs, and then that includes English proficiency tests and SAT results, and the benefits of the scholarship. And then it's broadcasted through Facebook, which is, I quote Maria Ressal, the internet of the Philippines. Okay. So that's that. I'll keep it from there for now. And then the extensions that I'm just building on for using Gemini API is, one, help students build their profile. So this is the start to finish part. So this is the starting part, build their profiles through one, helping them gather their achievements, two, help them build their profile, and three, help them build their profile, and four, help them build their profile. Helping them write foundational essays or essays that basically cover a range of the common questions a scholarship application might ask. And then the ability of using AI to rewrite and tailor that foundational essay with extra details if the student wishes, so that they will have a tailored response, but not entirely a generic chat GPT response. This goes for the achievement tracker as well. So an achievement consists of one, a resume bullet point style write-up, and then two is more evidence, more quantitative evidence, plus a reference, plus a space to add images or certificates, photos of the person during the event, and a space for a number for the reference, quality is quantity over quantity here. So for the essays as well, so once they have that foundational essay and they encounter a new question in the wild, and it seems like something that past essays could answer, they could just select the respective essays from the checkbox and optionally achievements that they want to bundle the essay with, so they could have, again, a non-generic tailored essay response. And then after that, there's also gonna be a personalized scholarship recommendation, so, imagine Tinder, that's the best experience I could give, or imagine YouTube recommendations where instead of videos, scholarships that the applicant is most likely to apply in because it's aligned with their interest is recommended to them, so it helps them get through the fluff. And because it's end-to-end, a lot of the Philippines doesn't have the SAT, well, at least a lot of public schools don't have it, so to help students prepare for that, there is Math-Eco for the math part of it, and Math-Eco is basically a website with a chat GPT interface, except the AI is trained to not give the answers of a math questions outright, but given the user's interest, rephrase the math question, for instance, instead of one plus one plus two plus two, so let's say you're into farming, so one carrot plus one carrot equals two carrots, and we could always go off the charts here, but it's gonna really follow up the intrinsic motivation, and around Math-Eco are just code cells where they can validate the answers with, a calculator and a graphing calculator, a sketchpad, there's even a text block where they can store important variables to answer it as they solve, there's also gonna be a recommended playlist on YouTube, and on the left side, there's gonna be a history of the previous chats, and on the middle left side, there's gonna be a collection of folders so that students can allocate, for example, calculus practice questions into the calculus folder, and on the other side, which is English proficiency test, there's also help for communication, I am developing Fluent, a text-to-speech slash a debate practicing bot where we utilize text-to-speech and speech-to-text so that both the AI and the student can talk to one another, and it specializes across four different use cases, which is one, question formation and question answering, answering to explanation, like how do you get someone non-technical to understand you, like stuff like that, using metaphors while in an explanation inappropriately, third is the ability to tell stories or narrate happenings in a very fluent way, and then four is the ability to defend slash debate an idea, so once that's done, because the government is sponsoring the fees for respective tests and admission fee, after that, they are gonna be submitting their application, and so that's how it's end-to-end, and there's even an application tracker for it, so that's what my entry for this Google Gemini API competition is.
