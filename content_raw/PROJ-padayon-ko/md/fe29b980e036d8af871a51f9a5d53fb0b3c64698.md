Red Bull has always been a pioneer in empowering athletes to push the boundaries of what’s possible. But today, we’re at the dawn of a new era, where intellectual athletes—innovators solving global challenges—deserve wings too. With Pango, we are helping millions of students in the Philippines who can’t afford college by providing AI-powered tools that guide them through securing scholarships, from start to finish.

A simpler version of Pango, which was just a scholarship repository, has already proven successful in helping students find opportunities. This shows that the demand is real and the impact is measurable. Now, with Google’s Gemini API and other advanced AI tools, we’re taking it to the next level, automating the entire process and making scholarships accessible to students who need them the most.

By supporting Pango, Red Bull has the unique opportunity to represent the first wave of intellectual athletes—problem solvers who are using technology and creativity to tackle real-world issues like access to education. This aligns perfectly with Red Bull’s mission of breaking new ground and leading in spaces where others have yet to venture.

Red Bull’s involvement could change the lives of millions of students, helping them realize their potential and lifting entire communities in the process. I believe this partnership could not only expand Red Bull’s influence into a new, intellectual arena but also create a powerful narrative that enhances the brand’s global storytelling efforts.

I understand Red Bull has a vast network and the power to connect me with individuals and organizations—whether international sponsors or government bodies—who believe in this mission. By working together, we can scale this impact, creating partnerships that make a real difference. I would deeply appreciate your help in connecting me with these resources, whether from Red Bull’s network or beyond, to take this project to the next level.

This is more than just funding—it’s about relationships and shared vision. Together, we can represent the first step in supporting a new generation of athletes—those who solve problems, innovate, and make the world better.
