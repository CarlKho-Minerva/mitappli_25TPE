# Padayun Ko — Scaling Up

- What is Padayon Ko — Scholarships for Filipinos
    - Carl’s YT Vid ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA6Wm2oLUdI))
        
        Oh, did you know that 3.3 million high school students in the Philippines give up college because they can't afford it?
        
        What they do instead is look for a job so that they may provide for their families.
        
        That is why I am using Google's Gemini API to build Padayan Ko, a platform that helps students secure scholarships from start to finish.
        
        This is our solution.
        
        You see, people have been visiting Padayan Ko since 2022 to apply for opportunities with step-by-step instructions.
        
        Now, we use Gemini along with other APIs to automatically bring information to them where the Filipinos are most active on Facebook.
        
        First time, our multilingual onboarding process, available in English, Tagalog, and Cebuano, gathers your information to create an elevator pitch about your origin story.
        
        Essential for networking.
        
        But we don't stop there.
        
        Gemini's embedding model also analyzes your profile to match you with three scholarships and give you a head start on your journey.
        
        But what I'm really excited for are the AI tools we've made to help you supercharge your scholarship applications.
        
        Let's take a guided tour.
        
        First stop, achievement tracker.
        
        Simply answer a few questions about your achievements, and then Gemini transforms them into bullet points and descriptions ready to impress any scholarship committee.
        
        Second, foundational essays.
        
        This section introduces you to 10 common application questions.
        
        Gemini will then help you write them without sounding too robotic.
        
        So don't you worry.
        
        But what are they for?
        
        Meet super essays.
        
        Gemini emerges your foundational essays and achievements to generate new essays tailored to new application questions.
        
        So you can copy paste and focus on applying.
        
        Quick note.
        
        You can either write or speak your input in any language.
        
        Thanks, speech to text via Google Chirp.
        
        From that input, we use the whole is greater than its parts approach by turning simple question answers into narratives for you to experience less cognitive load.
        
        And this is achieved by using comprehensive and modular AI prompts following Gemini's guidelines.
        
        Unfortunately, Filipinos studying in publicly funded schools don't take the SATs by default.
        
        We even have to take English proficiency tests just to be eligible for international scholarships.
        
        That is why in Patayin Ko, we have included practice bots.
        
        Meet Mathieu, our AI-powered math tutor.
        
        By converting abstract math questions into interest-aligned scenarios, Mathieu makes studying for the math sections in the SATs engaging.
        
        With a voice-only interface, Fluent helps you upskill your verbal communication with the option to focus on debating, storytelling, question-asking, or explanation.
        
        But how do you propose we solve climate change?
        
        After your conversation, Fluent gives you feedback.
        
        Now, all you have to do is submit that application, keep track of it, and...
        
        Hailing from the Philippines, our Nobel Prize winner is Juan.
        
        Thank you for solving World 100.
        
        Thank you.
        
        Thank you.
        
        Thank you.
        
        Thank you.
        
        Thank you.
        
        Thank you.

    - Carl’s Red Bull Pitch
        
        Did you know that 3.3 million high school students in the Philippines give up college because they can't afford it?
        
        That is why I am using Google's Gemini API to build Padayan Go, a platform that helps students secure scholarships from start to finish.
        
        Hi, I'm Carl, and I'm studying applied AI and computer science across four continents thanks to a scholarship.
        
        Padayan Go uses Google Cloud to match students with opportunities and power our AI.
        
        Our AI is a friend you can talk to about your achievements.
        
        It uses your experience to track your wins and personalize essays.
        
        It then leverages these two in my favorite feature, superb essays.
        
        Copy-paste and hit submit.
        
        Matthew makes math fun by tying abstract questions to personal interests while fluent helps you improve your English.

    - Red Bull Finals Pitch [(Loom)](https://www.loom.com/share/cee14814c2344e3396c3dd1c792fccf4?sid=eb19497f-8eb5-4b1b-b1c3-fb358263cf7f)
        
        Recognize this?
        
        Well, let me ask you a question.
        
        Why did Webflow, a startup worth $4 billion, put a kid from the island of La Palapo Cebu onto the tallest billboard of New York Times Square?
        
        Well, to answer that question, let me tell you a story.
        
        Let's rewind back to 2022.
        
        What you see here is me.
        
        I was a high school student driven by research from science investigatory projects, to robotics, and even the social sciences, which landed me a spot on Google Scholar.
        
        However, opportunities and resources felt limited in the Philippines, and eventually I discovered international scholarship.
        
        So I was already working at a company building software, so I had the privilege to take the necessary exams to apply.
        
        And get this, applying set me back 27,000 pesos.
        
        Imagine 27,000 pesos just for a chance of being accepted.
        
        But it was very exciting because I got a full right scholarship.
        
        Well, almost.
        
        It was very painful.
        
        I felt like a failure, and like hoping mechanism, I swore to apply to every scholarship possible.
        
        But navigating the application process was a nightmare.
        
        The information was scattered, the requirements complex.
        
        So I made my own scholarship database.
        
        Meet Badaianco, a simple list of available scholarships for Filipinos with all the information needed to apply in one spot.
        
        I turned it into an initiative which my high school adapted.
        
        And so one day, someone messaged my Facebook group and told me about a university.
        
        So I applied.
        
        And I got accepted with a scholarship.
        
        But still, the first few words that came out of my dad's mouth was, "Sorry, but we can't afford this."
        
        Cue coping mechanism.
        
        So I made a website looking for sponsorships.
        
        You know, who am I?
        
        What am I good for?
        
        What do I want to do?
        
        And the rest was history.
        
        And might I get your attention's judges?
        
        Please fill these boxes in because where did the scholarship take off?
        
        It's kind of a slippery slope.
        
        But the reason I got to Times Square was because of a scholarship.
        
        So it took me to New York Times Square.
        
        Because of that, this great pride for me to say, "Hello everyone, my name is Carl Kho.
        
        I major in computer science and minor in neuropsychology at Minerva University, where I study across seven different countries."
        
        The best part?
        
        It's not just me.
        
        Because of Padayon Ko, many students from my alma mater, Stec, get to enjoy international scholarships too. To date, 500+ students have received support from Padayon Ko and has landed national scholarships.
        
        That is why today I will be presented an upgraded Badaianco with AI because I want to multiply that impact for the 3.3 million Filipino students who stopped education because they couldn't afford it.
        
        This is my working prototype.
        
        Badaianco now features a cleaner interface.
        
        I can clearly see what the price is.
        
        And if I'm interested, I am greeted with friendlier language, teaching me how to claim it step by step.
        
        I also use AI along with other APIs to automatically bring the information to them, where Filipinos are the most active on Facebook.
        
        There we go.
        
        So, to our professionals in the audience, do you want to go back to being students again?
        
        You know, chase those dreams?
        
        Oh, you do?
        
        Well, let's put our student hats on and allow me to walk you through Badaianco's features.
        
        For our judges, here I show you feasibility, but please wait until the end of the demo to score me for uniqueness of ideas.
        
        Talk about being explicit.
        
        Okay, for first timers, we have an onboarding process.
        
        It is available in English, SIPWANO, and Tagado.
        
        This part also gathers your information, or after which we give users a surprise.
        
        Wait for it.
        
        And the surprise is their personal elevator pitch, essential for networking, because an introduction to the right person could go a long way.
        
        That's how I met Craig from MIT Media Lab.
        
        But we don't stop there.
        
        Gemini's embedding model, or Gemini is the AI behind, it is Google's AI, also analyzes your profile for surprise number two, but Dianco matches you with three scholarships to give you a head start on your journey.
        
        But what I'm really excited for are the AI tools to help you supercharge your scholarship applications.
        
        First stop, achievement tracker.
        
        Here, you can simply answer a few questions about your achievements, and then our AI transforms them into bullet points and descriptions ready to impress any scholarship committee.
        
        And it's not just any bullet points and descriptions.
        
        It's the XYZ format that people from Google recommend because of its ability to be quantified.
        
        Now let's zoom out.
        
        Pause.
        
        Why are they important?
        
        Have you played UNO?
        
        The card came before.
        
        You know how satisfying it is when a college asks you, did you accomplish anything in life and you're like, boom, I've had that ready the whole time.
        
        And so having a compilation in advance saves you time and energy.
        
        Bringing the same logic in, foundational essays.
        
        Foundational is the word here because this section introduces you to 10 common application questions that our AI helps you in writing.
        
        Again, UNO.
        
        But Diane-Coste AI will then become your personal editorial team.
        
        It gives you answers to an AI agent who is good at bringing out the important technical details, and someone who is good at writing stories, and someone who knows your style of speaking.
        
        So it won't sound too robotic.
        
        So don't you worry.
        
        But wait a second.
        
        Why are we even writing these achievements and essays?
        
        Well, these are for the ultimate essay.
        
        Meet super essays.
        
        This is where but Diane-Coste truly shines because our AI looks at your existing foundational essays and achievements, merges them to generate new essays.
        
        They're the new application questions.
        
        So all you have to do is copy paste and focus on applying.
        
        So, what was the feature that merges achievements and essays?
        
        Judges, please fill it in.
        
        It's super essays.
        
        A few quick notes.
        
        You can either write or speak your input in any language.
        
        For example, you may speak in...
        
        Or, "Sibuano," which is surprising even for me as a Sibuano.
        
        We also acknowledge that knowing how to start an achievement or writing an essay is difficult.
        
        That is why we emphasize turning simple question answers into narratives for you to experience less cognitive load.
        
        So instead of writing everything in one go, we just ask you one by one and then our AI merges them to form a cohesive story.
        
        And by Diane-Coste, AI also works better because we use comprehensive AI prompts as suggested by Google's prompt engineering guidelines.
        
        Unfortunately, Filipino studying in publicly funded schools don't take the essays by default.
        
        And as you've heard from my story, we even have to take English proficiency tests to be illegible for international scholarships.
        
        This is why we included practice spots in Padayan-Coste.
        
        Everyone, please welcome Matthew Yu, our AI-powered math teacher.
        
        By converting abstract math questions into interest-aligned scenarios, Matthew Yu makes studying for the math section in the SATs engaging.
        
        It also sports productivity tools such as calculators, even a graphing one, code environments, and a sketchback.
        
        Our second bot is Fluent.
        
        Fluent has a voice-only interface.
        
        So imagine talking to chat GPT but without a keyboard, just with your voice.
        
        This helps you upscale your verbal communication with the option to focus on debating, storytelling, forming the right question, and answering questions effectively, and even explanations.
        
        And the key here is frameworks, as you might see, but are guidelines for explanations.
        
        It's not just you trying to explain without guidance.
        
        It's even equipped with a natural sounding human voice, which is...
        
        But how do you propose we solve climate change?
        
        Yeah, I personally say it's my favorite.
        
        And the best part?
        
        After your conversation, Fluent gives you feedback on where you can improve.
        
        I hope the ideas were unique enough.
        
        Let's talk business.
        
        There are 23 million students in the Philippines.
        
        And we're targeting over 10.3 million junior and senior high school students.
        
        This represents a substantial market actively seeking educational opportunities and financial aid for higher education.
        
        For this, we project a conservative 2% market penetration in year one, reaching 206,000 students.
        
        We anticipate increasing this to 5% in year two and 10% in year three.
        
        And these are values that I got with help from my friends in Boston Consulting Group or BCG and PwC.
        
        These projections are based in our targeted marketing efforts, strategic partnerships, and growing demand simply for accessible scholarship information.
        
        For our premium model, it offers core features for free.
        
        We project a 5% conversion rate to our premium subscription price at 1,000 pesos a year.
        
        Imagine chat GPD costs 1,000 pesos a month.
        
        And if you were wondering what the three features were, this is it.
        
        You can always revisit this slide later.
        
        This translates to approximately 10.3 million pesos in year one alone.
        
        And in the next year, it's going to be 25.
        
        And in the next year, it's going to be almost a million dollars from just D2C revenue.
        
        For schools, we offer tiered subscriptions starting at 50,000 pesos a year for up to 500 students.
        
        So with approximately 60,000 schools in the Philippines, capturing just 1% in year one generates about 30 million pesos.
        
        We aim to increase this to 2% and 3% in subsequent years, yielding 60 million and 90 million respectively.
        
        While harder to quantify initially, we are also actively pursuing government partnerships, which we anticipate will contribute significantly to revenue in later years.
        
        Our primary costs include cloud computing, team salaries, content creation, and outreach expenses.
        
        We estimate a total operating cost of 15 million pesos in year one, scaling proportionately with user growth in subsequent years.
        
        So, how many students will Padayan go impact?
        
        In theory and hopefully 10 million.
        
        So judges, please fill it out.
        
        Here's a comprehensive view of our lean campus, capturing the essence of Padayan cost business model and strategy.
        
        Focusing on the problems faced by Filipinos, our solution simplifies the scholarship process making opportunities achievable and accessible.
        
        With a unique understanding of local needs, our competitive advantage positions us as the first comprehensive platform tailored for high school students and educational institutions.
        
        Our operating costs are again strategically planned with a focus on essential areas ensuring sustainable growth.
        
        Lastly, our diverse revenue streams from B2B subscriptions to a freemium model and this faves the way for financial sustainability and long-term success.
        
        And remember, it's not just financial success but global impact.
        
        Who knows, the next Nobel Prize winner is a Filipino student, just one scholarship away.
        
        Hailing from the Philippines.
        
        Our Nobel Prize winner is Huwan.
        
        Thank you for solving World Hunger Day.
        
        Thank you Red Bull Basement.
