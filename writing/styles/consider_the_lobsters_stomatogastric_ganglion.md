# Stylistic Analysis: Consider the Lobster's Stomatogastric Ganglion

## I. Structural & Organizational Analysis

| Element | Description/Examples (Quote an Example) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pacing** | An "hourglass" structure. It starts with a broad philosophical observation (AI vs. biology), narrows to an intensely focused, deep dive into a single neural circuit (the STG), and then dramatically zooms back out to a sweeping, metaphorical conclusion about life and technology. |
| **Section Flow** | Structured as a scientific parable. 1. **Introduction:** State the moral premise. 2. **Exposition:** Introduce the protagonist (the STG). 3. **The Twist:** Reveal the incredible, hidden complexity and impossible engineering constraints of the seemingly simple system. 4. **The Moral:** Connect the lesson of the STG back to the opening premise. |
| **Introduction Technique** | **Philosophical Hook + Contrarian Framing.** He opens by explicitly calling the piece a "**neuroscience parable**" and immediately contrasts the high-status work of AI media generation with the unglamorous, but far more complex, work of basic biology. Quote: *"There’s not much social cache in chewing, so it’s tempting to argue that a robot who can chew...is a trivial AI. But here’s the thing: robot chewing is actually a _more_ impressive engineering feat..."* |
| **Conclusion Technique** | **Elevated Metaphorical Synthesis.** He concludes not with a summary, but with a powerful and beautiful metaphor that reframes the entire concept of biological intelligence. The conclusion is inspirational and philosophical. Quote: *"When you picture a nervous system, imagine an endless tessellating choir... Every singer is terrible... But when they all raise their voices together it is beautiful harmony."* |

## II. Rhetorical & Voice Analysis

| Element | Description/Examples (Quote an Example) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tone** | **Reverent Awe / Didactic Wonder.** This piece departs from his usual cynicism. The tone is one of genuine admiration for the elegance and resilience of a biological system. He is a teacher, but one who is clearly in awe of his own subject matter. |
| **Author Persona** | **The Philosopher-Scientist.** Here, he acts less as a critic and more as a naturalist or philosopher, using a specific scientific case study to explore profound questions about life, complexity, and durability. Quote: *"Forget ChatGPT’s disembodied floating intelligence: picture Dr. Marder poking lobsters with needles."* |
| **Use of Humor** | **Playful & Self-Aware.** The humor is gentler, often poking fun at the esoteric nature of the subject matter. Quote: *"You would have to be the most boring person in the world to care about lobster chewing!"* or the practical reason for using lobsters: *"You can eat your subjects with considerably less guilt than in human research."* |
| **Rhetorical Devices** | **The Parable.** The entire article is structured as a parable, using the STG as a microcosm to represent the immense, messy, and robust complexity of all biological life. He also uses the **"Impossible Engineering Problem"** as a device to build appreciation for evolution's solution. |
| **Audience Relationship** | **The Storyteller / Enthusiastic Guide.** He anticipates the reader's potential lack of interest in the topic ("Who cares though?") and masterfully guides them, building suspense and wonder until they understand *why* this tiny bundle of neurons is so important. |

## III. Sentence-Level & Lexical Analysis

| Element | Description/Examples (Quote an example) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sentence Length** | Masterful variation. He uses long, flowing sentences to describe complex processes, then punctuates them with short, dramatic, and often italicized sentences for maximum impact. Quote: *"The lobster is _immortal_."* |
| **Paragraph Length** | Consistently short and focused, which is essential for making such a dense and specific scientific topic accessible to a general audience. |
| **Vocabulary** | **Precise High/Low Diction.** He uses highly specific scientific terms ("stomatogastric ganglion," "diminished senescence") but immediately grounds them in simple concepts ("chew and swallow," "they get stronger with age"), making his expertise feel accessible rather than alienating. |
| **Formatting** | Highly effective use of visuals. He includes images and, crucially, **animated GIFs** of the neural firing and circuit diagram. These aren't just decorative; they are essential to conveying the complexity at the heart of his argument. |
| **Citation/Grounding** | A mix of embedded links for sources and, uniquely in this piece, a footnote for a humorous, conversational aside, which adds to the storyteller persona. |

## IV. Key Takeaways on Style

*   **Signature Move:** The **"Microcosm as Metaphor."** The author's most powerful technique in this article is to take a tiny, obscure, and seemingly insignificant biological component (a lobster's chewing nerve) and elevate it into a profound and universal symbol of life's messy, redundant, and miraculous resilience.

*   **Best Example:** This passage perfectly encapsulates the article's core theme and the author's sense of awe. It translates abstract biological principles into a concrete, high-stakes engineering challenge, forcing the reader to appreciate the marvel of the biological solution.
    > "But how long would that microcontroller have to run? For lobsters this circuit is an existential requirement. If a lobster cannot chew it cannot exist. Thus, the circuit can never fail. It cannot be “turned off and turned on again.” It must have 100% uptime. It will never get replacement parts. There will never be maintenance and any repairs must be performed by the system on itself _while operating_."

# Consider the Lobster's Stomatogastric Ganglion

In this **neuroscience parable** I’ll explore a tiny piece of neural tissue: The stomatogastric ganglion, or STG. The STG is what marine decapods—crabs and lobster—use to chew and swallow.

Most recent interest in generative AI is driven by generative models that make text and images. Good writers and artists are rare in human society so there’s tremendous social cache in creating impressive works of media. Generative AIs enable machine learning engineers to access some of this cache by automating media creation. I’m not going to wade into that debate in this piece, but what I do notice is that “artist,” “writer,” and “engineer” are all identity labels that subsume an entire person into a job description.

If you equate an artist with their artwork and an engineer with their technologies, generative AIs seem like they stand to replace us. But if you have a more complete look at humans, generative AIs are missing some basic bits—like mouths. There’s not much social cache in chewing, so it’s tempting to argue that a robot who can chew like a crab or lobster is a trivial AI. But here’s the thing: robot chewing is actually a _more_ impressive engineering feat than ChatGPT’s writing. High social status has nothing to do with engineering difficulty or biological sophistication.

### Lobsters are delicious model organisms

I learned about lobster chewing from[ Dr. Eve Marder](http://blogs.brandeis.edu/marderlab/) when she gave a talk at my University of Illinois graduate program back in 2013. Dr. Marder’s lab at Brandeis makes computational models of simple nervous systems, and that means getting into the nitty-gritty of how a lobster’s nervous system is actually wired together. Eschewing abstract neuroscientific discussions of vague constructs like language and perception, Dr. Marder’s work is focused on the tangible electrical circuitry that moves the flesh, blood, fat, chitin, and chemicals necessary for running a lobster’s mouth. If you want to understand how brains actually work—both synthetic and biological—it’s critical to understand tangible, real-world tissues you can hold in your hand. Forget ChatGPT’s disembodied floating intelligence: picture Dr. Marder poking lobsters with needles.[1](https://howtogetsmarter.substack.com/p/consider-the-lobsters-stomatogastric#footnote-1-131432754)

Lobsters and crabs are popular model organisms in neuroscience because:

  1. Invertebrates have relatively large neurons without protective myelin sheaths. This makes their neurons easier to stab glass needles into for measuring electrical activity.

  2. Decapods are hard to kill and cheap to raise.

  3. You can eat your subjects with considerably less guilt than in human research.




The specific ball of neurons in question, the stomatogastric ganglion, consists of about 30 neurons. The STG controls the muscles on the the dorsal surface of a crustacean’s foregut, a kind of combination mouth/stomach like a cow’s rumen or a pigeon’s crop. This little blob of cells is about the size of the head of a pin:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!R3F7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed4957e0-310e-41d3-a5e6-58c82bca5e03_200x285.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!R3F7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed4957e0-310e-41d3-a5e6-58c82bca5e03_200x285.jpeg)Izhikevitch 2006

Every connection between these STG cells and the muscle fibers they are attached to is known to researchers. We even understand how various genetic factors are expressed to wire up the thing. There are biophysically realistic computer simulations of the STG’s neuromuscular activity that are so accurate as to be indistinguishable from those observed in the living organism.

What does the STG do? It chews and swallows.

The stomatogastric ganglion is a central pattern generator. More accurately, it’s two pattern generators taped together. The front one—the “gastric mill”—chews by moving the lobster’s lateral teeth back and forth over its medial teeth. The rear one—the “pyloric rhythm”—swallows by squeezing the muscles of the foregut to push ground up food into the lobster’s hind gut for further digestion. These two pattern generators trade off by reflex. Solids in the foregut trigger the chewing reflex, and liquids trigger the swallowing reflex.

Who cares though? You would have to be the most boring person in the world to care about lobster chewing! Two little reflexes trading off? Why are we looking at this thing when we could be prompting ChatGPT to write poetry? You’d think this was too simple and trivial to matter.

And you would be wrong.

### The existential watchmaker

Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins calls evolution a “blind watchmaker,” and it’s worth pausing to consider the STG as a piece of evolutionary engineering. Here’s a plot of the electrical signals recorded from the two reflexes with swallowing on top, and chewing on the bottom:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!20SU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef2aeda5-61cb-40a6-886d-dab1f8978e7c_300x349.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!20SU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef2aeda5-61cb-40a6-886d-dab1f8978e7c_300x349.gif)

An engineer who might want to build a synthetic STG has a simple functional goal: run the chewing, run the swallowing, switch back and forth as needed. It’s trivial to wire up a microcontroller to produce the above behavior in a couple hours.

But how long would that microcontroller have to run? For lobsters this circuit is an existential requirement. If a lobster cannot chew it cannot exist. Thus, the circuit can never fail. It cannot be “turned off and turned on again.” It must have 100% uptime. It will never get replacement parts. There will never be maintenance and any repairs must be performed by the system on itself _while operating_.

And the circuit must run _forever_. Lobsters are _immortal_. They exhibit what biologists call “diminished senescence”: they get stronger with age. The older a lobster, the healthier, larger, and more fecund it is. A ten pound lobster is about 50 years old. A 20 pounder has lived a century. While the core behavior is quite simple, what we’re really trying to make is a fully autonomous, self-sufficient, indestructible, immortal chewing machine.

Oh yeah, and it needs to be built while immersed in salt water, out of materials collected _by running the circuit itself_.

Faced with such a daunting challenge, one of the reasonable things an engineer might do is to try to simplify the circuit as much as possible. Less moving parts means less things to go wrong. Since we need two patterns we probably need two processors and a switch.

This is not what evolution did! Did you notice how there were 13 cells in the previous chart? That’s because the wiring for the stomatogastric ganglion actually looks like this:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9IJS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F908e0ffe-290e-47fe-bb9e-35214df623c5_684x537.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9IJS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F908e0ffe-290e-47fe-bb9e-35214df623c5_684x537.gif)

Remember, this whole thing exists _only_ to chew and swallow. Yet evolution made a wiring diagram roughly as complex as Bell’s original [telephone](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Electronic_circuit_diagrams#/media/File:American_telephone_practice_\(1905\)_\(14756423865\).jpg).

But actually, just counting cells and wires tends to undersell the complexity of the STG. Like most invertebrates, lobsters are extremely _chemically_ complex. Here is an incomplete list of the neurotransmitters and neuromodulators used by _each cell_ in the STG:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!K32W!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325993bb-a763-4fc4-88ec-ee3539771dc4_311x345.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!K32W!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325993bb-a763-4fc4-88ec-ee3539771dc4_311x345.gif)

My (probably out of date) understanding is that there are 60 known chemical signals in the stomatogastric ganglion. Between the wires and the transmitters, the number of parameters in the STG is about on the order of the number of parameters used in the famous “[Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)” paper: the paper that describes the architecture of sequence-to-sequence transformers that you probably know better by their brand names: ChatGPT and stable diffusion.

Surely this is overkill for a lobster tummy? Why on earth would you need so much processing sophistication to chew?

### Chaos is the nature of things

The world that lobsters and humans live in _cannot_ be made simple. Entropy is the guiding principle. Health is temporary. Our circuits will fail. It is not merely that time breaks things down. There is no beginning “pure” state from which to decay—due to individual genetic variation, many lobsters don’t even express some of the neurotransmitters required by the circuit. There is no perfect, working version of an STG found anywhere in nature.

And yet the lobster chews.

Systems composed of central pattern generators like the STG are common in all nervous systems. Many behaviors require a smooth, repetitive signal, like a metronome or bass line music. Breathing relies on a pattern generator located in the [brainstem](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9784928/). A cicada’s droning [wingbeat](https://elifesciences.org/articles/60454) is driven by one of these. The motion of a cockroach’s [legs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/dneu.22738). The [sinoatrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinoatrial_node) node that beats the human heart. If you want to coordinate any behavior with any exterior physical object you are going to need to drive muscle tissue in time with the external world.

Suppose you wanted to set up a circuit to chew some food. You could put the food in a bag, and set up a metronome so that the swinging arm would mash the side of the bag every second or so. Then you could set up a second metronome that would pull open the bottom of the bag and dump out the food scraps every few seconds. This would work well unless the two metronomes got off from each other. Then the circuit would break. So you add a third metronome, and a fourth, and a fifth. With each new element, the timing becomes more reliable—inaccuracies in the timing due to some of your timers being fast and some slow will tend to cancel each other out. The system fails gracefully.

Every lobster is filled with a vast collection of ticking clocks. Each of these clocks is composed of smaller ticking clocks, and most of the clocks are broken. But the lobster is not broken. The lobster is immortal.

The tree of life is a tangle of living and dead parts. Unlike technology, which always works best on paper, biology survives contact with reality. Our technology is absolutely ephemeral compared to biological individuals. An iPhone lasts about as long as a rat. Imagine how expensive a computer that lived as long as a human would be. There are lobsters living right now that pre-date the lightbulb. There are [bowhead](https://www.americanoceans.org/facts/oldest-whale/#:~:text=Whales%20are%20some%20of%20the%20longest%20living%20mammals%20on%20Earth,have%20lived%20for%20268%20years.) whales that lived through the Civil War and Greenland sharks from the [Renaissance](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37047168). And this focus on the individual completely undersells biological durability. Life has been around for billions of years because biology is happy to reboot life forms. That’s what death and birth are for.

Modern AI technology like ChatGPT seems impressive, until you realize it does not have to coordinate its output with the real world. It relies on a biological being to do this: a human reader. AI also depends on biological life support for its inputs. We speak casually about “training a new model” as if that is an process that happens automatically, rather than the result of some machine learning graduate student who might rather work in the lab that gets to eat lobsters at the end of the year. Being a writer is a fine thing! Being an engineer is a fine thing! But having a nervous system—a real one, full of broken bits—is a far finer thing.

Fluid, robust, and natural behaviors require massive assemblies of redundant parts all working together. Generative AI is a robust system that can survive contact with the real world, it’s an attempt to provide narrow economic value in the domain of media creation. It’s a poor picture of a human nervous system, and fears of AI replacement can only thrive in an audience with a poor mental picture of how brains actually work. When you picture a nervous system, imagine an endless tessellating choir stretching off into the distance. Every singer is terrible. Each one of them is out of tune, and out of synch, and some are sick with laryngitis. But when they all raise their voices together it is beautiful harmony.
