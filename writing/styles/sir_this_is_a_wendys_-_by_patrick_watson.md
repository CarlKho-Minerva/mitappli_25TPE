# Stylistic Analysis: Sir, This is a Wendy's

## I. Structural & Organizational Analysis

| Element | Description/Examples (Quote an Example) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pacing** | Essayistic and methodical. It opens with a leisurely historical anecdote (the automat), then accelerates as it traces the "media digestive system" from press release to Reddit. The pace then slows for a deliberate, ground-truth analysis of the actual work inside a Wendy's. |
| **Section Flow** | The argument is built around a central historical analogy. He introduces the automat, presents the modern Wendy's story, and then uses the history to deconstruct the hype. Headings are thematic and guide the reader through different lenses of analysis: operations, marketing, and media theory. |
| **Introduction Technique** | **Historical Analogy Hook.** He masterfully reframes a current tech story by starting a century in the past with the automat. This immediately signals that his analysis will focus on historical patterns, not just technological novelty. Quote: *"The automat fad lasted about 40 years. Most automats closed during the great depression..."* |
| **Conclusion Technique** | **Grand Sociological Synthesis.** The conclusion zooms far out from Wendy's to make a sweeping statement about media, capitalism, and the nature of modern "knowledge work" as a form of performance, brilliantly tying back to Charlie Chaplin and the industrial revolution. Quote: *"Most of us in the knowledge economy work acting jobs... And of course, if you know how to put on a good show, you probably already possess all of the tools you need to convince your audience..."* |

## II. Rhetorical & Voice Analysis

| Element | Description/Examples (Quote an Example) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tone** | **Deeply Cynical and World-Weary.** The tone is that of a seasoned analyst who has seen this exact hype cycle countless times. It is dissecting and critical, not just of the technology but of the entire media and business ecosystem that promotes it. |
| **Author Persona** | **The Critical Media/Business Analyst.** He sheds the lab coat of the neuroscientist and dons the hat of a historian and business strategist. His focus is on incentives, brand value, and marketing narratives, treating the technology itself as almost secondary to the story being sold. Quote: *"Wendy’s AI drive-thru is for brand building. AI is cool."* |
| **Use of Humor** | **Caustic and Acerbic Wit.** The humor is sharp and intellectual, often used to dismiss absurd claims. Quote: *"And finally [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13dbdcn/ai_chatbot_to_replace_human_ordertakers_at_wendys/)—the lower intestine of the internet digestive system—excretes the following..."* |
| **Rhetorical Devices** | **Deconstruction of a Hype Cycle.** His core device is showing the reader the primary source (the press release) and then demonstrating, step-by-step, how media outlets distort it for engagement. This builds a powerful, evidence-based case for his cynical take. |
| **Audience Relationship** | **Fellow Conspirator / Critical Thinker.** He speaks to the reader as if they are in on the secret, sharing a behind-the-scenes look at how the sausage of tech news is made. He assumes the reader is smart enough to see through the hype with him. |

## III. Sentence-Level & Lexical Analysis

| Element | Description/Examples (Quote an Example) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sentence Length** | A strategic mix. Complex sentences lay out the historical context and business theory, while short, blunt sentences deliver his core verdicts. Quote: *"Drive-thru orders are a task, not a job."* |
| **Paragraph Length** | Consistently short and focused, making a complex multi-disciplinary argument easy to follow in a digital format. |
| **Vocabulary** | **High/Low Diction (Business & Media).** The "high" vocabulary is drawn from business and media studies ("sociocapital exchange," "gravitas," "combinatorics"). This is mixed with plain, direct language ("gooses the story up") to make the analysis feel both sophisticated and grounded. |
| **Formatting** | Purposeful and clear. **Bolding** is used sparingly for emphasis, while block quotes are used effectively to present the "evidence" from media sources that he is about to deconstruct. |
| **Citation/Grounding** | Consistent use of embedded hyperlinks to provide sources for historical facts (the automat), media articles, and cultural references, maintaining his credibility as a well-researched analyst. |

## IV. Key Takeaways on Style

*   **Signature Move:** The **"Historical Framing Takedown."** The author's most powerful technique here is using a deep historical parallel (the automat) to completely invalidate the perceived novelty of a modern tech story. He argues that to understand the future, you must first understand the patterns of the past, especially the timeless incentives of marketing and brand-building.

*   **Best Example:** This paragraph perfectly captures his shift from a purely technical analysis to one focused on brand, psychology, and ritual. It's the intellectual core of his argument and demonstrates his ability to see the human story behind the business decision.
    > "Consider Starbuck’s [directive](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704164004575548403514060736) to baristas to not make more than two drinks at a time. Customers complained when baristas created assembly-lines to more efficiently churn out batches of drinks at busy times. In other words, part of what customers wanted was the experience of having a specific person _pay attention_ to their drink. The ritual of a human interacting with your food is part of what you pay for at Starbucks."

During the industrial revolution mechanical technology was cool. Fast-food capitalized on this by creating the [automat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automat): a fully mechanized restaurant that dispensed drinks, cooked meals, and served customers without front-of-the-house human contact. The automat fad lasted about 40 years. Most automats closed during the great depression because labor was cheap and because having no employees was bad PR. The novelty of being served by a machine kept a few automats holding on. The last one, [Horn and Hardar](https://www.nypl.org/blog/2010/12/08/horn-hardart-automats)t, closed in 1991 having survived for years as a NY tourist trap. It’s a [Gap](https://www.google.com/maps/search/200+E+42nd+St,+New+York,+NY+10017/@40.7508399,-73.9746869,19.04z) now. Automation in restaurants continues to thrive, but with machines backstage and people out front. Modern fast-food joints are mirror images of the automat.

This is important historical context for Google’s recent [presser](https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/2023-05-09-Wendys-Taps-Google-Cloud-to-Revolutionize-the-Drive-Thru-Experience-with-Artificial-Intelligence) announcing a partnership with Wendy’s to develop Drive-thru bots:

> "Wendy's introduced the first modern pick-up window in the industry more than 50 years ago, and we're thrilled to continue our work with Google Cloud to bring a new wave of innovation to the drive-thru experience,"
>
> Todd Penegor, President and CEO of Wendy's

It’s interesting to see Penegor describing a 1971 pick-up window as innovative almost a century behind the automat. This amnesia continues as the announcement passes through the media digestive system. First there is relatively staid coverage in the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wendys-google-train-next-generation-order-taker-an-ai-chatbot-968ff865), describing the announcement, but adding the weasel-y and unreferenced:

> “Up to 80% of food orders at Wendy’s are made at the drive-through lane.”

Next [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23716825/wendys-ai-drive-thru-google-llm) gooses the story up with some snide opinion:

> “Hangry people don’t want to hear about your GPU shortage and how it’s slowing down their orders — just saying.”

And finally [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13dbdcn/ai_chatbot_to_replace_human_ordertakers_at_wendys/)—the lower intestine of the internet digestive system—excretes the following:

> “AI chatbot to replace human order-takers at Wendy's drive-thru. 13.9 million displaced.”

This hype cycle needs to neglect the historical perspective that the automat provides. It feels really strange for me to read these articles, because as a professor of machine learning who’s worked in both academia and industry developing machine learning systems, I think about the historical context all the time. To make a system that can actually work I need to understand the prior art—both technologically and economically.

Yet I like this case because I don’t think it takes much specialized knowledge to understand the hype that’s going on here. I think you just need to visit a Wendy’s.

### Making food is easy, but food service is hard

A fast-food restaurant is already a highly automated system. Specially prepackaged food is placed into custom machines with preset cycles to produce highly consistent outputs. There’s some minor combinatorics to assemble condiments and options so that the customer can “have it their way” but even this is partially automated process. This automation happens to look more like bottles with specific nozzle sizes to get the dose of mayonnaise just right. It’s a different, more functional aesthetic than the spidery chrome robot arms that usually imagine when we think of automation. Fast-food workers are already what Amber Case would call “[cyborgs](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/amber-case-were-already-cyborgs/):” organisms in obligatory feedback loops with the machines they operate.

Importantly, the worker who takes the drive-thru order _mostly_ focuses on food assembly and delivery. Drive-thru orders are a task, not a job. The drive-thru worker typically wears a headset so their hands are free to operate machines, clean, and do food prep. Taking the order is actually a small part of what they’re doing. Besides, the ordering system itself is _already_ fully automated. You can go to [Wendy’s website](https://www.wendys.com/?utm_source=paid-search&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=always-on&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpPKiBhDvARIsACn-gzCdZ4D5LNTqCUCecInYqkn_aWkMDa89Lny7j-HqDL68nfEYDS_ZQKcaAhHwEALw_wcB) right now and order whatever you like. You won’t need ChatGPT to do so: just click on the items you want. Typing your order out for a chatbot would be an annoying unnecessary step.

So there’s little inefficiency in the ordering process for AI to correct. The task of taking orders in the drive thru is already fully automated for customers who order online, and the in-person orders are already taken by workers who are mostly doing other stuff anyway. Wendy’s knows this, and has modest [ambitions](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wendys-google-train-next-generation-order-taker-an-ai-chatbot-968ff865):

> The goal, Mr. Penegor said, is to get more customers through the drive-through in the shortest amount of time, picking up extra sales for every minute or so shaved off the ordering process.

I think even this is unlikely to pan out. Most of the AI projects I worked on when I was at IBM research were exploratory, and it was pretty rare where we could beat a human at an ordinary task. And there’s also little reason to think that advances in large language models such as ChatGPT are what is missing. The main job that the person taking the drive-thru orders is doing _isn’t_ language processing, it’s _hearing_. The sensory processing necessary to translate what the person in the car is saying is hard! There’s traffic noise, wind, food prep sounds, sentences that get cut off and so on. Filtering all of this noise into text is a _far_ more challenging machine learning task than understanding that “quarter pounder” and “hamburger” are sometimes interchangeable symbols. And again, Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud’s CEO, identifies this as the actual technology they’re working on:

> Among other challenges, Mr. Kurian said, there can be a lot of extraneous noise in a family car, such as music or children in the back seat. The software has to cut through these sounds and focus on the person making an order and the kind of language they are using… “It’s a very complicated technical problem.”

I don’t think that this sensory problem represents an insurmountable gap. Speech-to-text systems are pretty good now and are getting ever better due to the large sonic data sets eagerly donated by users of Hey Google, Alexa, and Siri. But speech-to-text remains brittle. Especially in noisy environments or for speakers with accents other than “white man from the midwest.”

But even if the audio problem was somehow solved (hard), and even if this did result in an appreciable reduction in food prep time (unlikely), I still think that it wouldn’t result in Wendy’s replacing any employees—and neither does Wendy’s.

### Fresh, made-to-order rituals

Wendy’s slogan is “[Fresh, made-to-order.](https://www.wendys.com/csr-what-we-value/food/quality/fresh)” Their primary appeal is that the customer will get better quality fast-food cooked on a griddle by a person in a paper hat. Wendy’s tries to position itself between McDonalds and diner food/fast-casual. Wendy’s has been happy to adopt the same automated machines for dispensing coke, ice cream, and mayo as everyone else. But they trumpet the value of certain ritual practices—such as not freezing their hamburger meat. Their marketing attempts to convince the customer that this makes their products “better” than their competition.

This performance relies on shared fiction. Do you actually like hamburgers that haven’t been frozen better? Can you tell? Have you every thought about it at all? I haven’t and I’m pretty sure Wendy’s relies on customers not deeply engaging with these questions. Like all companies, Wendy’s profit margin depends on the gap between how much their product costs to make and how much their customers are willing to pay.

This is why I think Wendy’s is turning to AI after their painful post-pandemic restructuring. AI _might_ save them a trivial amount of time and money. But just as with the automat, new technology is cool! Wendy’s is interested in AI is as a _marketing_ appeal.

A good comparison might be how Starbucks maintains their brand value. Consider Starbuck’s [directive](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704164004575548403514060736) to baristas to not make more than two drinks at a time. Customers complained when baristas created assembly-lines to more efficiently churn out batches of drinks at busy times. In other words, part of what customers wanted was the experience of having a specific person _pay attention_ to their drink. The ritual of a human interacting with your food is part of what you pay for at Starbucks.

Starbucks knows this! They _desperately_ don’t want you to think about efficiency when you’re buying coffee. Their markup is [80%](https://drinkstack.com/coffee/cost-starbucks/)! The gap between what Starbucks costs to make and what customers are willing to pay signals almost Apple-level brand value.

Getting coffee is a social ritual. Starbucks has monetized that ritual very effectively. Wendy’s tries to create the social agreement that frozen hamburgers are bad. All economic transactions involve embedded social signaling. No will die for want of a latte. We buy a latte to express something about ourselves: our social position, our values, and the general fiction that brings meaning to our lives. Wendy’s inclusion of AI in their drive thru probably won’t save them money, but it may allow them to make the argument that their product is more interesting, smart, high-tech, and futuristic than their competitors.

This is a fine line to walk—it may turn out that customers enjoy the old drive-thru ritual. Being paid attention to—even by a minimum-wage worker for a couple of minutes—is of some real value. I have an acquaintance who’s retired dad goes several times a day to the deli to buy coffee and talk to the staff. His fridge is completely full of half-empty coffee cups. It’s not about the coffee. He’s paying to hang out at the deli during work hours. [America runs](https://news.dunkindonuts.com/news/dunkin-donuts-launches-new-advertising-campaign-america-runs-on-dunkin-sm) on this kind of sociocapital exchange.

Technological capitalism has been far more successful at manufacturing stories, ideas, entertainment, and brands than it has been at making real products. It’s nearly always cheaper and easier to make [media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Lovin%27_It_\(song\)), even [whole new forms of media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneak_King) that promote your product than it is to actually do the difficult technical work of improving efficiency. Changing your customers’ mental “software” is effective, invisible, and need not result in productivity gains to be profitable. It’s a good bet that you’re reading this article at work—that is a form of technologically mediated entertainment that probably actually lowers your efficiency.

Wendy’s AI drive-thru is for brand building. AI is cool. Investors and customers are interested the experience of using ChatGPT to order a burger. Such a system might increase the value of the product that Wendy’s delivers allowing them to charge a little bit more. Or it might create a tiny boost in efficiency allowing them to sell a little bit faster. Or it might just get them a transfusion of cash from investors. But even if it hurled the culture of fast-food back to the late 19th century automat that wouldn’t be particularly scary or sexy.

Pursuit of fictional brand value is also why the media ecosystem needed to juice up Google’s press release. The last century of technical advancement has made it virtually impossible to make information transmission faster or more efficient. You can get first-hand battle footage from the war in Ukraine uploaded from soldiers’ phones for free in real time. So the WSJ, and the Verge, and Reddit need to build brand value by manufacturing gravitas, snark, and paranoia. Media companies—just like Wendy’s—are leveraging AI technology not to increase their efficiency, but to increase their perceived importance.

### Love and Robots

The automat was built on branding and the combination of selling both food and an entertainment experience: watching clever little machines deliver the food. It wasn’t meaningfully cheaper or more efficient than other forms of fast-food prep. But it could also pad the bottom line selling visions of a shiny, worker-free utopia.

At least until the emergence of newer, more powerful media technologies. Charlie Chaplin’s depression-era film _[Modern Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Times_\(film\))_[(1936)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Times_\(film\)) popularized the idea that new technologies were not cool. For millions of out-of-work people, the idea that robots were going to take their factory jobs was genuinely concerning. Four years later, Chaplin’s “[The Great Dictator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Dictator),” drove home the message by making the automation of genocide in Europe the new mental image of the technological future embodied in the chrome-and-enamel machines of the automat.

Never mind that Chaplin’s factory _itself_ was a commercially successful fiction mediated by new technology. _Modern Times_ was a machine for effectively disseminating the idea that mechanization produces dystopian, alienating, and de-humanizing physical spaces while simultaneously utilizing depictions of such spaces to arouse engagement, interest, and outrage. The story of the 20th century is the story of using extremely cheap, efficient media technology to re-narrate industrialization’s brand value. Media technologies slowly morphed the automat into a restaurant full of of paid actors. And as Chaplin would have known better than most—there’s virtually no ceiling on what you can convince customers to pay to see a theatrical performance.

It’s actually not a surprise to me that the first-generation of AI that seems poised to actually have a major impact on economic life is Generative AI. Most of us in the knowledge economy work acting jobs. Industrialization has ensured that few people need to grow food or build houses. The rest of us can focus on creating entertaining diversions for each other. And of course, if you know how to put on a good show, you probably already possess all of the tools you need to convince your audience to consume more of your particular brand of entertainment.
