# Stylistic Analysis: How to get Smarter with Neuroscience

## I. Structural & Organizational Analysis

| Element | Description/Examples (Quote an Example) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pacing** | **A Masterful Pitch.** The pacing is fast, energetic, and designed for maximum impact in a short space. It moves rapidly from promise (get smarter) to proof (credentials) to a core, contrarian idea (Turing test) and finally to a moral mission statement. |
| **Section Flow** | **Persuasive Funnel.** The structure is a classic funnel: 1. **Hook:** A bold, humorous promise. 2. **Authority:** An undeniable list of credentials. 3. **Problem:** Acknowledges a common frustration. 4. **Solution:** Presents the newsletter as the answer. 5. **Mission:** Elevates the "product" into a moral cause. |
| **Introduction Technique** | **Promise + Proof.** The article opens with a playful, high-value promise ("make you 20% brighter") and immediately follows it with an exhaustive paragraph listing his academic and professional accomplishments. This establishes both personality and authority right away. |
| **Conclusion Technique** | **Moral Call to Action.** He concludes not with a summary, but with a profound statement of purpose, framing the entire newsletter as a quest for decency, generosity, and grace in a world of hype and brutality. Quote: *"The goal of these pieces is to consider thinking things—of all sorts—with depth and grace."* |

## II. Rhetorical & Voice Analysis

| Element | Description/Examples (Quote an Example) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tone** | **Rebellious Expertise.** The tone is a carefully crafted blend of unimpeachable authority (from his credentials) and a witty, slightly conspiratorial rebelliousness against the "assorted jerks" promoting AI hype. |
| **Author Persona** | **The Insider with a Conscience.** He positions himself as the expert who has seen how the sausage is made and has decided to use his inside knowledge for good—to empower his audience against manipulation rather than to contribute to it. |
| **Use of Humor** | **Dry & Intellectual Footnote Humor.** A key stylistic marker is his use of footnotes for witty, self-aware asides. This rewards attentive readers and reinforces his persona as someone who is both serious and doesn't take himself *too* seriously. Quote: *"[1] Offer void with subscription."* |
| **Rhetorical Devices** | **Moral Re-framing of a Technical Concept.** His most powerful device is the re-contextualization of the Turing Test. He moves it from a simple computer science prompt to a profound moral parable about passing, persecution, and decency, using Turing's own life as the lens. |
| **Audience Relationship** | **Building a Tribe of "Wise Skeptics."** He speaks directly to an audience that he presumes is intelligent but perhaps anxious or weary of the current AI discourse. He invites them into a community built on bravery, wisdom, and creativity. |

## III. Sentence-Level & Lexical Analysis

| Element | Description/Examples (Quote an Example) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sentence Length** | Overwhelmingly short and punchy. The one very long sentence is the list of his accomplishments, a deliberate choice to make it feel comprehensive and slightly overwhelming. The rest is designed for clarity and impact. |
| **Paragraph Length** | Extremely short, often single-sentence paragraphs. This is classic, effective writing for a digital manifesto, ensuring every point lands with force. |
| **Vocabulary** | **Deliberate High/Low Diction.** The "high" vocabulary is concentrated in his list of credentials ("Computational Neuroscience," "clinical trial"). The core argument and mission statement are delivered in simple, powerful, and accessible language ("assorted jerks," "brave, wise, and creative"). |
| **Formatting** | **Explicit and Declarative.** He uses **bolding** to name his three core article types, making his "product offering" perfectly clear. The use of a block quote for Turing's words gives them weight and importance. |
| **Citation/Grounding** | Hyperlinks are used strategically to prove his claims (linking to his clinical trial, book, etc.) and to provide the primary source for his central exhibit (Turing's paper). Every link serves to build credibility. |

## IV. Key Takeaways on Style

* **Signature Move:** The **"Manifesto via Moral Re-framing."** The author's defining move in this piece is to take a widely known technical concept (The Turing Test) and imbue it with a deep, personal, and moral significance by tying it to the tragic biography of its creator. This single act elevates the entire newsletter from a mere tech blog to a project with a profound ethical core.

* **Best Example:** This paragraph perfectly encapsulates his entire project: it identifies the enemy, draws a sharp moral distinction, and states his mission to create a better-informed audience.
    > "I was inspired to create the newsletter because I felt that the recent discourse around AI—specifically large language models and image generators—is coming from actors who are trying to frighten, bullshit, and muddle their audience into acting foolishly. It’s one thing for a queer intellectual like Turing to use his brains tactically against the state that was brutalizing him. It’s quite another for corporations, politicians, and other assorted jerks to use those tactics to bully the less powerful."

# How to get Smarter with Neuroscience - by Patrick Watson

I’m Prof. Watson and this is **How to get Smarter with Neuroscience** , a twice-monthly newsletter on neuroscience and artificial intelligence guaranteed to make you 20% brighter or your money back![1](https://howtogetsmarter.substack.com/p/coming-soon#footnote-1-119899867)

I’ve spent my career studying intelligence at every level: publishing papers in machine learning, neuroscience, psychology, and sociology and earning a Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience. I was lead analyst on the world’s largest brain-training [clinical trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02780739), helped build a [meaning-making](https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/icarus) machine, developed [new measures](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hKZYIxYAAAAJ&hl=en) for human memory, worked on IBM’s [robot tutor](https://www.ibm.com/watson/advantage-reports/ai-social-good-education.html), and co-authored a [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262544009/individual-and-collective-memory-consolidation/) on how collectives learn. Now I teach machine learning at the world’s [most innovative](https://www.wuri.world/%EB%B3%B5%EC%A0%9C-2022-global-top-100) University.

I’m often asked “How do I get smarter?” by anxious students, older family members, and peers from other disciplines. For years I gave the standard research advice for good brain health: “Eat right, exercise, get enough sleep, pay attention to what you’re doing.” But everybody hates that advice!

Luckily there’s another way.

## Fake it

While it’s hard to be smart it’s easy to make *other people seem dumb.*

Most people know the [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) as a computer attempting to fool humans into thinking it’s a human. But that’s not the way that legendary computer scientist and codebreaker Alan Turing described the test in his [1950 paper](https://phil415.pbworks.com/f/TuringComputing.pdf):

> “The ‘imitation game’ is played with three people: A man, A), a woman, B), and an interrogator, C), who may be of either sex… The object of the game is for the interrogator to tell which of the other two is the man and which is the woman…
>
> Now we ask the question, ‘What will happen when a machine takes the part of A) in the game?’ Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often as when the game is played between a man and a woman?

Turing wrote the paper while he was on parole. Despite his critical and brilliant code breaking work for the British government during WW2, Turing was charged with “indecency” for a relationship with another man and avoided jail time only by agreeing to estrogen injections. So when he was asked whether computers could be considered intelligent, he pointed out that the authorities seemed to care far more about passing than intelligence.

The Turing test also showcases its author’s razor-sharp wit—or, at least his ability to make himself seem intelligent *by comparison*. It plays with gender and deception to [stress](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Poonam-Malik-6/publication/266586816_High_IQ_Adolescents_Under_Stress_Do_They_Perform_Poor_in_Academics/links/5e86e85aa6fdcca789eca548/High-IQ-Adolescents-Under-Stress-Do-They-Perform-Poor-in-Academics.pdf) out its participants. It invites its audience to [assume](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1979-26013-001) that Turing sort of knows everything about how intelligence works. And, by intentionally complexifying the definition of intelligence through inventing this test, Turing ensured that he could never be proved wrong: only different.

You too can acquire this power simply by reading this newsletter![2](https://howtogetsmarter.substack.com/p/coming-soon#footnote-2-119899867)

# Why Now?

I was inspired to create the newsletter because I felt that the recent discourse around AI—specifically large language models and image generators—is coming from actors who are trying to frighten, bullshit, and muddle their audience into acting foolishly. It’s one thing for a queer intellectual like Turing to use his brains tactically against the state that was brutalizing him. It’s quite another for corporations, politicians, and other assorted jerks to use those tactics to bully the less powerful.

I prefer an audience that’s brave, wise, and creative. And so I’ll cover three kinds of stories in this newsletter: **AI critiques, under-the-hood tutorials,** and**neuroscience parables**.

**AI critiques** pick apart hyperbole about AI, reducing the anxiety that these articles attempt to induce. **Under-the-hood tutorials** provide some expert knowledge about the inner workings of machine learning systems. **Neuroscience parables** describe examples from animals, brains, and ecosystems that challenge our ideas of what intelligence is. I intend for this newsletter to show how the AI magic tricks are done, disrupting the ways that the idea of intelligence is used to harm and control others.

Because ultimately, I think Turing’s test is a moral one. I think he wanted to live in a world that was more generous. He did not think that deciding whether something was intelligent was a prerequisite to treating it with decency. His own experience taught him that intellectual fireworks were no charm against brutality.

The goal of these pieces is to consider thinking things—of all sorts—with depth and grace.
