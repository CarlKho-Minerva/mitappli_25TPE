# MIT Media Lab Portfolio Piece: Quick-Start Checklist

Use this before writing each new portfolio piece in `/frontend/portfolio/content_raw/`

---

## 🎯 **Pre-Writing: The 5-Question Filter**

Before you start writing, answer these:

1. **What gap did I fill?** (Technical, documentation, knowledge, tool)
2. **Why did that gap exist?** (Economic incentives, technical constraints, social structures)
3. **What did I learn about systems/people/design?** (Meta-lesson, not just technical skills)
4. **What research question emerges?** ("How might we..." framing)
5. **Which MIT group(s) does this speak to?**
   - Fluid Interfaces → Cognitive load, behavior change, HCI
   - Multisensory Intelligence → Multimodal AI, creative tools, sensors
   - Camera Culture → Sensing invisible, health-tech, social impact

## 📝 **The 5-Section Template**

Every piece needs all five sections:

### **1. Personal Hook (100-200 words)**
- [ ] Quantified personal usage/observation
- [ ] "Magic" moment or elegant simplicity
- [ ] Critical insight that breaks the magic
- [ ] 1-2 witty hyperlinks

**Example opener:**
> "I [action] approximately [number] times a [period]. It was [year], I was [context], and I'd discovered that [insight]. (Parenthetical showing critical thinking.)"

---

### **2. Gap Analysis (200-400 words)**
- [ ] What exists vs what's missing
- [ ] Incentive analysis (company vs user perspective)
- [ ] Economic/social framing (information asymmetry, moats, public goods)
- [ ] "The gap isn't malicious. It's structural."

**Key phrases:**
- "Consider the economics from their side:"
- "Meanwhile, I'm sitting here thinking:"
- "Companies build **products**. Developers need **tools**."

---

### **3. Implementation Journey (400-800 words)**
- [ ] Initial naive approach
- [ ] Specific obstacles (use bullet lists)
- [ ] "The [Number] Problem" section
- [ ] 1-2 media suggestions (architecture diagrams, timelines)
- [ ] Callout box for key challenge

**Must include:**
- Specific numbers (lines of code, hours spent, dependencies)
- List of hidden complexities
- Media suggestion with interpretive caption

---

### **4. Human Story (300-600 words)**
- [ ] Personal circumstances with dates
- [ ] Non-technical obstacles
- [ ] Moments of doubt/frustration
- [ ] Persistence despite challenges
- [ ] Evidence (screenshots, timeline visualization)

**Key structure:**
> "Let me be clear about what was happening in parallel:"
> [Specific dates and circumstances]
> "I wasn't just [technical work]. I was **fighting to stay in the conversation**."

---

### **5. Meta-Lesson & Research Vision (300-500 words)**
- [ ] Scale/reach of work (numbers, impact)
- [ ] Pattern recognition ("Every X has gaps between Y and Z")
- [ ] Research question ("If there's a research agenda here, it's this:")
- [ ] Connection to broader principles
- [ ] Final powerful statement

**Formula:**
> "The real insight from this experience isn't about [specific tech]. It's about **[concept]**."
>
> "If there's a research agenda here, it's this: **[How might we...]?**"

---

## 🔗 **Hyperlink Checklist (Aim for 30-40 links)**

### **Technical Credibility (12-15 links)**
- [ ] Official documentation
- [ ] APIs, SDKs, frameworks
- [ ] Academic papers or research
- [ ] Technical specifications

### **Cultural Fluency (9-12 links)**
- [ ] XKCD or relevant webcomics
- [ ] Wikipedia concepts
- [ ] Hacker News or community references
- [ ] Memes or internet culture

### **Domain Expertise (9-12 links)**
- [ ] Obscure but relevant concepts
- [ ] Industry frameworks (twelve-factor app, Diátaxis)
- [ ] Economic/business terms (moats, public goods)
- [ ] Design patterns or philosophies

**Remember:** Link the most semantically meaningful word, never "click here"

---

## 📸 **Media Suggestion Checklist (Aim for 5-8)**

### **Required Media Types:**
- [ ] Architecture/flow diagram (visualize system complexity)
- [ ] Timeline visualization (show process over time)
- [ ] Screenshot (provide evidence/proof)
- [ ] Comparison image (before/after, simple/complex)

### **Format for Each:**
```markdown
> [!INFO]
> **📸 Image Suggestion: [Descriptive Title]**
> [What to create/find, where to source it, why it matters]
> Save as `descriptive-file-name.png` in `frontend/src/assets/images/`.
>
> **Caption:** "[Interpretive insight—what should reader notice?]"
```

**Caption Quality Test:**
- ❌ "Screenshot of the interface"
- ✅ "The microphone button: 44 pixels of interface hiding 400 lines of engineering"

---

## 🎨 **Formatting Checklist**

### **Callout Boxes (3-5 per piece)**
- [ ] `[!WARNING]` for challenges/setbacks
- [ ] `[!INFO]` for context/media suggestions
- [ ] `[!SUCCESS]` for achievements/insights

### **Emphasis Strategy**
- [ ] **Bold** for key concepts, numbers, takeaways
- [ ] *Italics* for internal dialogue, emphasis
- [ ] `Code` for technical terms, filenames

### **Rhythm Elements**
- [ ] Single-sentence paragraphs for drama
- [ ] Bullet lists for complexity
- [ ] `***` for major section breaks
- [ ] Short paragraphs (3-5 lines max)

---

2. Why **gaps exist** (systems-level understanding)
3. What you **learned** (meta-insights, not just skills)
4. What **questions emerge** (research vision)
5. How you **persisted** (human story + grit)

**The Golden Formula:**
```
Personal Hook + Gap Analysis + Technical Journey + Human Story +
Meta-Lesson + Research Vision = MIT Media Lab Delight
```

**Your Superpower:**
Making complexity **legible** (not hidden, not overwhelming).
Showing the 400 lines beneath the 44-pixel button.
