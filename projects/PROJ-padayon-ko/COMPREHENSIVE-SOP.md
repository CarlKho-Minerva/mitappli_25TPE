## The Hook: A Billboard in Times Square

In the heart of New York City, amidst the dazzling chaos of Times Square, a billboard displayed a picture of a young man from a small island in the Philippines. That young man was me. This wasn't a fashion ad or a promotion for a blockbuster movie; it was a testament to a journey fueled by a refusal to accept limitations and a drive to empower others.

That moment—seeing my face on one of the world's most iconic stages—wasn't about personal glory. It was validation that a kid from the Philippines, armed with nothing but determination and a laptop, could create something that matters. It was proof that the barriers I once thought insurmountable were just challenges waiting to be solved.

## The Origin: Where Curiosity Met Constraint

My passion for technology began not in a state-of-the-art lab, but in a small classroom in the Philippines, where resources were scarce, but curiosity was abundant. I devoured every science book I could find and poured my energy into robotics and research projects. However, the path to higher education was fraught with financial hurdles that threatened to derail my ambitions. The dream of studying abroad seemed almost unattainable, a world away from my reality.

### Early Beginnings

Growing up in the Philippines, I was fascinated by how things worked—from simple machines to complex algorithms. My high school years were defined by:

- **Robotics competitions** where we built functional robots with limited budgets
- **Research projects** exploring computer science and AI, despite having no formal lab facilities
- **Self-taught programming** through free online resources and community forums
- **Science fairs** where I presented projects on machine learning and automation

But reality always crept in. While my peers in developed countries had access to cutting-edge equipment and well-funded programs, I was piecing together knowledge from wherever I could find it. The financial barrier wasn't just about tuition—it was about access to opportunity itself.

### The Scholarship Near-Miss

The breaking point came during my senior year of high school. I had poured months into applying for a prestigious international scholarship. I crafted what I thought was a perfect application, backed by genuine passion and demonstrated achievement.

I came close. So close.

But I didn't get it. And neither did hundreds of other brilliant Filipino students who deserved a chance just as much as I did.

---

## The Catalyst: Turning Pain Into Purpose

The disappointment of that near-miss scholarship was a turning point. It wasn't just a personal setback; it was a reflection of a broken system that left countless brilliant Filipino students behind. The statistics were staggering:

- **3.3 million Filipino high school students** forgo college annually due to financial constraints
- Scholarship information was scattered across dozens of websites, social media posts, and word-of-mouth
- No centralized platform existed to help students navigate the complex scholarship landscape
- Many students didn't even know what scholarships were available, let alone how to apply effectively

I realized something crucial: **If I was struggling with this, thousands of others were too.**

That's when I decided to build **Padayon Ko**.

### What is Padayon Ko?

"Padayon Ko" means "Let's move forward" in Visayan, one of the major languages in the Philippines. It's more than just a platform—it's a movement.

**Padayon Ko is an AI-powered scholarship platform designed to democratize access to education for Filipino students.**

## The Initiative: Building the Solution

### Phase 1: The MVP (Notion + No-Code Tools)

I started with what I had: a laptop and determination.

- **Notion as a database**: I manually curated hundreds of scholarship opportunities
- **Simple spreadsheet**: Organized deadlines, requirements, and eligibility criteria
- **Word-of-mouth distribution**: Shared with classmates, then with other schools
- **Initial impact**: Helped 50+ students in my immediate network find and apply for scholarships

The response was overwhelming. Students were desperate for this information, and they started sharing it with their friends, who shared it with their schools.

### Phase 2: Scaling with Webflow

As demand grew, I knew a Notion page wouldn't scale. I taught myself Webflow—a no-code platform valued at $4 billion—and rebuilt Padayon Ko as a proper web application:

- **Searchable database** of 500+ scholarships
- **Filter system** by eligibility, deadline, and scholarship type
- **Resource hub** with essay tips and application strategies
- **Community forum** where students could share experiences and advice

**Impact**:
- **500+ students** from my high school alone secured scholarships (local and international)
- Platform visits grew from dozens to thousands per month
- Featured by local news outlets and education organizations

### Phase 3: AI-Powered Features with Google Gemini

The real transformation came when I integrated Google's Gemini API to create intelligent, personalized features:

#### 1. **AI Essay Assistant**
- Analyzes scholarship prompts and provides tailored writing guidance
- Generates personalized essay outlines based on student's background
- Offers real-time feedback on essay drafts
- Helps students articulate their stories compellingly

#### 2. **Multilingual Onboarding**
- Supports Tagalog, Visayan, and other Philippine languages
- Breaks language barriers for students from rural areas
- Makes the platform accessible to non-English speakers

#### 3. **Personalized Scholarship Matcher**
- Uses AI to match students with relevant opportunities
- Considers academic background, financial need, and interests
- Sends proactive notifications about deadlines

#### 4. **AI Math Tutor** (Expansion Feature)
- Helps students prepare for entrance exams
- Provides step-by-step problem-solving guidance
- Makes quality test prep accessible to all

### The Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Webflow (for rapid iteration and accessibility)
- **AI Engine**: Google Gemini API
- **Database**: Airtable (for flexible scholarship data management)
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics (to understand user behavior)
- **Hosting**: Cloud-based for 24/7 availability

### Qualitative Impact: Stories That Matter

Numbers tell part of the story, but the real impact is in the messages I receive:

> "Carl, I'm the first in my family to go to college. Thank you for making this possible."

> "Padayon Ko helped me find a scholarship I never knew existed. I'm now studying engineering abroad."

> "Your platform gave me hope when I thought college was impossible."

These aren't just testimonials—they're proof that technology, when built with empathy and purpose, can change lives.

## The Full Circle: From Struggle to Solution to Scholarship

That billboard in Times Square was more than just a picture; it was a symbol of my journey and a promise for the future. The challenges I've faced and the solutions I've built have solidified my passion for using technology to create social impact.

### Why Minerva University? Why Now?

Minerva's unique educational model aligns perfectly with how I've already been learning and building:
