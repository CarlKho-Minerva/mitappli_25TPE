Steps taken

1. Define a function to clean and remove fillers from the user input.
2. Define an alternative function to translate and clean non-English input.
3. Define a function to extract key information from the cleaned input.
4. Define a function to structure the extracted information using the X-Y-Z formula.
5. Define a function to generate a resume bullet point from the structured achievement.
6. Define a function to generate a detailed description from the bullet point and structured achievement.
7. Define a function to refine, optimize, and separate the bullet point and detailed description for a specific purpose, such as a scholarship application.

# Input

- Initial Input
    
    ```markdown
    I'm raising an end-to-end scholarship product and one of the features I offer is the ability to track achievements.
    Not only track this but have AI rewrite it into the most optimized form so that may be used in accomplishments or it would be given to schools in the future.
    So what I'm going to be doing next is I'm going to be feeding you three articles.
    I'm going to paste it one at a time and what I want you to do is turn all of those findings or insights and convert them into one bullet point of guidelines for my potential.
    For a student would be a potential scholar and convert them into easy to digest questions, one-liner questions so that students in the future individually answer when they're faced with the question, "What is your accomplishment?"
    I'm going to be doing that for, I want you to do that for three forms and after that, after I paste everything in and you give me your feedback, I'm going to paste all of your bullets and questions and I want you to curate and give me the best ones that would most likely be used for scholarship applications.
    Do you get it?
    Thank you.
    ```

    Achievement Description Guidelines
    
    We're going to help you create powerful descriptions of your achievements for scholarship applications or resumes. Don't worry about sounding perfect or stumbling over your words - our AI will clean everything up later. Just focus on answering these questions as thoroughly as you can:
    
    1. What specific goal or task did you accomplish?
    2. Can you quantify your results? (Think numbers, percentages, or measurable outcomes)
    3. What specific actions did you take to achieve this result?
    4. How many people were involved or impacted by your work?
    5. What leadership role did you play, if any?
    6. What challenges or obstacles did you overcome?
    7. How long did this achievement take? Provide a timeframe.
    8. What skills did you develop or demonstrate through this experience?
    9. How does this achievement relate to your future goals or field of study?
    10. What makes this accomplishment unique or stand out?
    11. If applicable, how much money was involved? (funds raised, budget managed, etc.)
    12. How did this achievement impact your community or organization?

    Remember:
    
    - It's okay to speak casually or even ramble - just focus on providing detailed information.
    - Don't worry about organizing your thoughts perfectly - the AI will structure your achievement later.
    - If you can't answer all questions, that's fine. Just provide as much detail as you can for the relevant ones.
    - Feel free to include any additional information you think is important, even if it doesn't fit these questions exactly.
    
    Your detailed responses will help our AI create a polished, impactful description of your achievement. Just relax and tell us your story!
