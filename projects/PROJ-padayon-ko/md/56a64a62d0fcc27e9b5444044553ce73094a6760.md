# Lean Canvas | @October 20, 2024

- **BUILDING the AI Prompt for Business Canvas**
    
    But the idea here is NOT to make an eco-friendly thrift clothing store or something. It's actually to just generalize the canvas so that it may adapt to every other or other product. So make it flexible but still in the theme of Red Bull Basement. - AI Prompt for Business Canvas
    
    ```
    Help me tailor lean business canvases. Given this template, for extra context, I'm participating in Red Bull's basement, Red Bull Basement, so it's like a hackathon, and so I want to talk about the business potential, you know, make it shine, but I don't know how. So, improvise or revise this ideal pitch into something that meticulously modifies or talks about the lean canvas version of a certain business scenario.
