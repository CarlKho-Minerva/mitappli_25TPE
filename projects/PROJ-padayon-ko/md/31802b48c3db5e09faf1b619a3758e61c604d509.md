Lastly, I need your help creating the user-facing write-ups, because this will be a notion. So first of all, I want to be transparent with the algorithm. So based on the algorithm you made, I want you to create a block, and each block follows this format. Number one, it shows you the logo of what tech was used. And for context, the logos we have is Gemini API, Notion, Cloud Run Cloud Function, Vertex AI, and the user, and Padainco, which is my app, which is represented by its own logo. And the way you format this is logo, name of the tool, the instruction it does, or what it actually executes. And then a quick, very brief caption going in depth, no, like a very brief caption of the more technical stuff. For example, we have the logo Padainco. The tool is called Padainco via Python, and then the instruction is caches and beddings, and then the description is caches, summaries, and JSON for unchanged content. So I want you to create all of that step-by-step for Matthew. So that's the first part. And for the second part, this is going to be user-facing in Notion. So the whole structure for this is that it's going to be on Notion. It's going to be pasted. And the way it is under a page called Math Practice. So I'm not sure what the best way to structure this is, but I just want you to create right up to that number one, introduce us what Matthew is, what problem it solves, and how they can get started, but also give them caveats that their data isn't going to be saved. And you spell them about the features and how they can use it. Specifically, the features are the chat, interest-align chat with image generation. On the right column, we have calculators, a graphing calculator, and a scientific calculator. And then on the second row, this left-right column is code interpreters, Python, Sage, Mathematica, whatever. And please add in the iframes if you can in the future. Just recommend me sites that I could add in. And then last is Sketchpad, which of course features Excalibur. So that's about it. To summarize, the first thing I want you to do is to create a flow chart with a specific block format. And then for the second part is I want you to create user-facing write-ups that I intended to be placed in Notion. Thank you.
