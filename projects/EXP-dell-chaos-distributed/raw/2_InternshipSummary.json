I\u0027m ready to begin the second phase of this documentation process.\n\n\n**Resuming Batch 2 Documentation**\n\nI\u0027m continuing the documentation of the Dell internship, now focusing on Batch 2 of the Microsoft Teams screenshots. I\u0027m extracting key details from each image, ensuring I maintain chronological order and the requested format. Specifically, I\u0027m focusing on messages from my interactions to populate the required fields like action, people involved, files, links, and next steps, to create a structured timeline for Harsh.\n\n\n**Detailing Team Interactions**\n\nI\u0027m now analyzing the interactions on July 16th, starting with a request for input on the final presentation. I\u0027m focusing on my messages to extract the requested information like the people involved, and the next steps. I\u0027m noting the team\u0027s responses, including the slides request, and Lin\u0027s story tickets. I\u0027m tracking the chronological flow based on the timestamps.\n\n\n**Summarizing July 16th Activities**\n\nI\u0027m now summarizing the interactions from July 16th, building on previous documentation. My initial message requested input for the final presentation. Team members including Guo, Lin, Seelam, and Karunakara responded. The request for the presentation deck was clarified, I agreed to share it later. Additionally, Lin shared new story tickets for me, and Karunakara suggested scheduling a meeting for real-time use cases. I agreed to meet on Tuesday.\n\n\n**Tracking Week of 21st July**\n\nI\u0027m now documenting the discussions from Monday, July 21st. I shared the revised project plan, requesting the team\u0027s feedback, particularly critical assessments, as we\u0027re two weeks from the final presentation. Also, I shared an image explaining the goal of our experiment. I described the objective: triggering specific conditions to observe system behavior for developers and QA to reproduce failure scenarios. My communications with the team are currently focused on feedback and practical demonstration preparation.\n\n\n**Analyzing Further Team Discussions**\n\nI\u0027m now documenting the discussions from July 16th and 21st, focusing on the team\u0027s feedback and the evolution of our project plan. I detailed the initial presentation planning, and the team members, including Guo, Lin, Seelam, and Karunakara\u0027s responses. I\u0027ve also noted Lin\u0027s assignment of new story tickets, the request for a Tuesday meeting, and the sharing of a video. Finally, I summarized the goal of our experiment and the workflow.\n\n\n**Defining Application Progress**\n\nI\u0027ve documented key messages from July 16th to 25th in Batch 2. On July 16th, I requested team input for the final presentation. Then I clarified we\u0027d share the presentation deck. Lin assigned new story tickets.

On July 16th, I requested team input for the final presentation, and then clarified that we would share the presentation deck once it was created. I also took note of Lin assigning new story tickets. On July 21st, I shared the revised project plan and the project\u0027s visual depiction. After that, I successfully got the application running and added more updates. I\u0027ve strictly maintained the format to uphold the chronological order.\n\n\n**Summarizing Application Updates**\n\nI\u0027ve made great progress on the application, detailing messages from July 16th to 28th. I initiated presentation planning, got team input, and clarified deck sharing. Lin assigned new story tickets. On July 21st, I shared the revised project plan and the project\u0027s goal visually. I then got the application running in both Baremetal and VM, sharing screenshots. Finally, I added chaos types, implemented dynamic input validation, and made chaos-mesh installation simpler for the team.\n\n\n**Refining Documentation and Progress**\n\nI\u0027ve documented key messages from July 16th to 28th, focusing on application updates. I requested team input for the presentation and clarified deck sharing. Lin assigned story tickets. I shared the project plan and explained the goal. I ran the application in Baremetal and VM, adding chaos types, dynamic input validation, and simplifying chaos-mesh installation, which I\u0027ve shared with the team. I also made some changes to the presentation slides based on Lin\u0027s feedback.\n\n\n**Analyzing Early July Interactions**\n\nI\u0027m currently documenting the interactions from July 16th to 28th.
