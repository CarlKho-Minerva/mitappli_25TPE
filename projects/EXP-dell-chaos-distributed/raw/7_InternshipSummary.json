      "text": "Of course. Congratulations on finishing your internship at Dell! Leaving on a professional and organized note is crucial. Here is a comprehensive checklist and best practices guide for your final days.\n\n### Part 1: The CRITICAL Part - \"SCP-ing Everything\" and Intellectual Property\n\nThis is the most important section. Misunderstanding this can have serious legal and career consequences. **DO NOT simply copy all your work files to a personal device.**\n\nYour work product—code, documents, presentations, spreadsheets, designs—created during your internship is the intellectual property (IP) of Dell. Taking it without permission is a violation of your employment agreement and Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), and can be considered theft.\n\n**What you SHOULD do instead:**\n\n1.  **Identify Portfolio-Worthy Work:** Pinpoint 1-2 key projects that you are proud of and that best demonstrate your skills.\n2.  **Ask Your Manager for Permission (The Right Way):**\n    *   **Schedule a meeting.** Do not do this over a quick chat message.\n    *   **Explain your goal:** \"I\u0027m incredibly proud of the work I did on Project X. For my future career portfolio, I would love to be able to showcase the skills I developed. Would it be possible for me to save a sanitized version of my work?\"\n    *   **Offer to Sanitize It:** This is key. Propose removing all proprietary Dell information. This means:\n        *   No confidential data, customer names, or internal metrics.\n        *   No server names, internal URLs, or API keys.\n        *   Removing Dell logos and confidential markings.\n        *   For code, this might mean keeping a small, non-critical functional snippet or, even better, writing a high-level description of the architecture and the problems you solved.\n3.  **Get Permission in Writing:** If your manager agrees, follow up with an email summarizing your conversation: \"Hi [Manager\u0027s Name], thanks for chatting with me. To confirm, I have your permission to save a sanitized version of my presentation on [Project X] for my personal portfolio. I will be removing all confidential data and internal branding.\" This creates a paper trail that protects you.\n4.  **Focus on Describing, Not Showing:** Often, the best portfolio piece isn\u0027t the file itself, but a well-written summary. On your resume or LinkedIn, you can say: \"Developed a Python script to automate data processing, which reduced manual effort by X%.\" You don\u0027t need the actual script to prove it.\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Digital Laptop Cleanup Checklist\n\nYour goal is to remove all personal data and credentials before IT wipes the machine.\n\n**☐ 1. Backup Your Personal Files**\nAnything that is truly yours and not Dell\u0027s property.\n*   **Photos:** Any personal photos you may have saved.\n*   **Documents:** Personal notes, resume drafts, non-work related documents.\n*   **Bookmarks:** Export your browser bookmarks if you\u0027ve saved personal links.\n*   **Method:** Use a personal cloud service (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive) or a personal USB drive (if Dell policy allows connecting them). **Do not mix personal and work files in your backup.**\n\n**☐ 2. Browser \u0026 Application Cleanup**\n*   **Clear Browser Data:** Go into your browser settings (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) and clear all history, cookies, and cached data.\n*   **Delete Saved Passwords:** This is critical. Go to your browser\u0027s password manager and delete all saved passwords.\n*   **Log Out of All Accounts:**\n    *   **Personal Accounts:** Spotify, personal Gmail/Outlook, Apple ID, etc.\n    *   **Company Accounts:** Manually log out of Slack, Microsoft Teams, Outlook, and any other work-related software.\n\n**☐ 3. Uninstall Personal Software**\nIf you installed any personal applications (like a personal password manager, music app, etc.), uninstall them.\n\n**☐ 4. Clean Your Desktop \u0026 Downloads Folder**\nDelete any downloaded installers, personal files, and tidy up the desktop. This prevents you from accidentally leaving personal data behind.\n\n**Note:** You do not need to (and should not) perform a factory reset or wipe the OS yourself. The Dell IT department has a professional and secure process for this. Your job is just to remove your personal footprint.\n\n---\n\n### Part 3: Administrative \u0026 HR Wrap-Up\n\n**☐ 1. Finalize Your Hours**\n*   Submit your final timesheet.\n*   Double-check with your manager that it has been approved. This ensures your final paycheck is accurate.\n\n**☐ 2. Legal Documentation (Exit Paperwork)**\n*   You will likely have an exit interview or paperwork to sign with HR or your manager.\n*   This will probably include a final affirmation of your NDA.\n*   **Read what you sign.** Ask for a copy for your records if possible.\n\n**☐ 3. Final Paycheck \u0026 Expenses**\n*   Ask HR or your manager when you can expect your final paycheck.\n*   If you have any outstanding expense reports, submit them immediately.\n\n---\n\n### Part 4: Professional Networking \u0026 Farewell\n\nThis is how you turn a good internship into a future job offer or a strong reference.\n\n**☐ 1. Knowledge Transfer**\n*   Leave your projects in a good state.\n*   Ensure your code is commented, your documents are organized on the shared drive (e.g., SharePoint, OneDrive), and you\u0027ve provided a brief handover document for your manager or team. This makes you look incredibly professional.\n\n**☐ 2. Connect on LinkedIn**\n*   **Before you leave,** send LinkedIn connection requests to your manager, your mentor, team members, and other interns you worked with. It\u0027s much harder to find them after you\u0027ve lost access to the internal directory.\n*   Write a short, personalized note: \"Hi [Name], I really enjoyed working with you on the [Team/Project] team during my internship. I\u0027d love to stay in touch!\"\n\n**☐ 3. Ask for a Reference or Recommendation**\n*   The best time to ask is during your last week, while your great work is still fresh in their minds.\n*   Ask your manager or a key mentor: \"I\u0027ve learned so much here and really valued your guidance. Would you be comfortable being a professional reference for me in the future, or perhaps writing a brief recommendation on LinkedIn?\"\n\n**☐ 4. Send a Thank You Note**\n*   On your last day, send a farewell email to your team.\n*   Send a separate, more personal thank you email to your direct manager and any key mentors who helped you. Thank them for the opportunity and mention a specific skill you learned or a project you enjoyed.\n\n**☐ 5. Exchange Personal Contact Info**\nFor colleagues you truly want to stay in touch with, it\u0027s okay to share personal email addresses or connect on LinkedIn for future networking.\n\n---\n\n### Part 5: The Physical Handover\n\n**☐ 1. Gather All Company Assets**\n*   Laptop\n*   Laptop Charger / Power Brick\n*   Company Badge / ID Card\n*   Any other peripherals (mouse, keyboard, docking station, headset) they provided.\n\n**☐ 2. Confirm the Handover Process**\n*   Ask your manager or check with IT for the exact procedure. Do you leave it at your desk? Do you take it to the IT help desk? They will give you specific instructions.\n\nGood luck with your future endeavors! Ending your internship professionally sets a fantastic foundation for your career.",

Here is a detailed breakdown of what you need to do with this information before you lose access, and why it\u0027s so important for your future.\n\n### The Immediate Action Plan: What to Do RIGHT NOW\n\nBefore you hand in that laptop, your primary goal is to create a secure personal archive of your entire employment and payment history with Dell.\n\n**☐ 1. Download EVERY Pay Statement as a PDF**\n*   Do not just save screenshots. On the ADP portal, for each pay period (Aug 1, Jul 18, etc.), there should be an option to \"View Statement,\" \"Print,\" or \"Download.\"\n*   Choose the option to view the full, detailed statement.\n*   Use the \"Print to PDF\" function in your browser to save a clean, multi-page PDF of each individual paystub.\n*   **Name them clearly:** Use a consistent format like `2025-08-01_Dell_Paystub.pdf`.\n\n**☐ 2. Download EVERY Tax Document Available**\n*   Navigate to the \"Tax\" or \"Tax Statements\" section in ADP.\n*   Download your **Form W-4** (the form you filled out for tax withholding when you started).\n*   **Crucially, find out how to access your 2025 W-2.**\n    *   Your W-2 is the official summary of your total earnings and taxes paid for the year. You will NOT get this until **January 2026**.\n    *   **Ask HR or your manager:** \"Since I am leaving, what is the process for former employees to access their W-2 on ADP next January?\" They will likely have an \"alumni\" or \"former employee\" portal. **You must confirm this process before you leave.**\n\n**☐ 3. Look for Other Documents**\n*   Check for any other documents related to your pay, like the details of that \"$2,182.91 Relocation\" payment. Download any associated agreements or explanations.\n\n**☐ 4. Organize and Back Up Your Files**\n*   Create a folder on your personal computer or personal cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) named something like **\"Dell Internship 2025\"**.\n*   Place all the downloaded PDFs inside this folder.\n*   This is your permanent record. Keep it safe and secure.\n\n---\n\n### Why This is CRITICAL for You (as an F1 Student)\n\nSaving these documents isn\u0027t just for good record-keeping; it\u0027s essential for taxes, future jobs, and immigration.\n\n**1. U.S. Tax Filing (Your #1 Priority)**\n\n*   **You MUST file a US tax return** next year (by April 15, 2026) for the income you earned in 2025.\n*   **Non-Resident vs. Resident:** As an F1 student, you are likely considered a \"non-resident alien for tax purposes\" unless you meet the Substantial Presence Test. This affects which tax forms you use (likely the **Form 1040-NR**).\n*   **FICA Tax Exemption:** F1 students are typically exempt from Social Security and Medicare (FICA) taxes for their first five years in the US. Looking at your paystub, it only shows \"Federal Income Tax\" and no deductions for Social Security or Medicare. This is **great news** and suggests Dell\u0027s payroll handled your F1 status correctly. Your paystubs are proof of this.\n*   **U.S.-Philippines Tax Treaty:** There is a tax treaty between the U.S. and the Philippines that may offer benefits to students and trainees. It could potentially allow some of your income to be exempt from U.S. taxes. Your paystubs and W-2 are necessary to claim this benefit when you file your taxes. You will likely need specialized tax software (like Sprintax) or a tax professional familiar with international student filings.\n\n**2. Proof of Legal Employment \u0026 Future Immigration**\n\n*   **OPT/CPT Records:** These paystubs are concrete proof that you were legally employed under your F1 visa\u0027s work authorization (CPT or OPT). This is vital for maintaining your visa status.\n*   **Future Visa Applications (H-1B, Green Card):** If you plan to apply for a work visa (like H-1B) or permanent residency in the future, immigration authorities will require extensive proof of your past employment and legal status. These paystubs and W-2s are exactly what they will ask for. Having a complete, organized record will save you immense stress later.\n\n**3. Future Job Applications \u0026 Salary Negotiation**\n\n*   **Proof of Experience:** Your paystubs are undeniable proof of your internship at a major company like Dell.\n*   **Salary History:** When you apply for full-time jobs after graduation, having a record of your intern pay (your paystub shows a rate of ~$31.80/hr) is a useful data point for negotiating your first salary.\n\n---\n\n### Your Final Checklist for ADP \u0026 Pay\n\n*   **[  ] Download Every Single Pay Statement as a PDF.**\n*   **[  ] Download Your W-4 and any other available documents.**\n*   **[  ] Ask HR/Manager about the process to get your W-2 form in Jan 2026.**\n*   **[  ] Create a secure digital folder (\"Dell Internship 2025\") on your personal cloud/computer.**\n*   **[  ] Place all downloaded documents in this folder.**\n*   **[  ] Research tax filing for F1 students and the US-Philippines tax treaty so you are prepared for next year.**\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI assistant. This information is for guidance and is not a substitute for advice from a qualified tax professional or immigration lawyer. Given your specific situation, it is highly recommended to use a service like Sprintax or consult a professional for your tax filing.",

This requires a granular approach, not a bird\u0027s-eye view. The nuances of each slide will be crucial.\n\n\n**Outlining the Response**\n\nI\u0027ve crafted a slide-by-slide structure, ready to unpack the images. Each section will begin with a concise slide summary, followed by actionable guidance tailored to the user\u0027s F1/PH student status and upcoming graduation. I\u0027m focusing on the \"why\" behind each piece of advice to make it more impactful.\n\n\n**Structuring the Coaching Plan**\n\nI\u0027m now fully immersed in the tactical approach. The goal is to provide slide-by-slide coaching that aligns with the user\u0027s specific circumstances. Each section will begin with a concise summary. I\u0027ll include checklists for actionable items. The user is on the cusp of graduation, so the advice must incorporate that. I\u0027ll also add value by providing context for each piece of advice based on their F1 and PH status.\n\n\n**Formulating a Granular Plan**\n\nMy focus has shifted to crafting a detailed response.  I\u0027m now structuring the slide-by-slide plan, ensuring each slide gets its own section. Key actions are emphasized by connecting them to the user\u0027s F1/PH/graduation context. Checklist format is incorporated to improve clarity, and a positive encouraging tone is set. I\u0027m actively integrating the user\u0027s prior action related to ADP to avoid redundancy.\n\n\n**Analyzing Key Slide Content**\n\nI\u0027m now fully immersed in the individual slide analysis. I\u0027m focusing on connecting each actionable item back to the user\u0027s F1/PH/graduation context to add value. Checklist format is used for clarity and tracking. I\u0027m addressing the user\u0027s prior action related to ADP to reinforce its importance. I will continue to add details about specific slides in my analysis.\n\n\n**Crafting a Detailed Breakdown**\n\nI\u0027m now outlining a detailed slide-by-slide strategy to address the user\u0027s need. I\u0027ll connect actionable items to the F1, PH, and graduation context for maximum value. Checklist format for easy tracking. I\u0027m leveraging the user\u0027s prior ADP action. I\u0027m focusing on providing context.\n\n\\n\\nI\u0027m deep in the implementation phase, writing the response. I\u0027m focusing on the \"so what\" for each point. Key actions are emphasized.  I\u0027m tailoring my advice to their F1/PH status and imminent graduation. I\u0027ve begun drafting, with each slide getting its dedicated section and the user\u0027s context woven in.\n\n\\n\\nI\u0027m now creating the response body. I\u0027m using each slide as a building block. I\u0027m making each actionable item understandable. The user\u0027s F1, PH, and graduation status are now focal points.  I have outlined how to tailor the advice, especially for topics like taxation.\n\n\\n\\nI\u0027m currently composing a comprehensive response, breaking down each slide for action items. I am making sure the advice will be practical, and using the user\u0027s F1/PH/graduation context to tailor and give it value. I\u0027ve finished the rough draft.\n\n\n**Implementing Slide-by-Slide Coaching**\n\nI\u0027m now writing the detailed slide-by-slide plan, ensuring clear and actionable advice. Each action item is tailored to the user\u0027s specific circumstances (F1, PH, graduation). I\u0027m focusing on providing context.\n\n\n**Formulating the Full Response**\n\nI\u0027m now fully immersed in crafting the complete slide-by-slide coaching document.

Let\u0027s break it down slide-by-slide, focusing on exactly what you need to do, especially considering your F1 visa status and future plans.\n\nYou\u0027ve already handled the most critical ADP registration, which is a fantastic head start. Now let\u0027s integrate that with the rest of this information.\n\n---\n\n### **Slides 1-4: Introduction \u0026 Agenda**\n\n*   **Slide 1: Title Slide (\"Summer Interns End of season close out\")**\n*   **Slide 2: Photo Collage (\"What an Incredible Summer It\u0027s Been!\")**\n*   **Slide 3: Agenda**\n*   **Slide 4: HR \u0026 Payroll Header**\n\n**What it means:** These are the introductory slides setting the stage. They confirm this is the official guide for your internship closeout.\n\n**Your Action Items:**\n*   **☐ Save a Memory:** If you are in any of the photos on Slide 2, take a screenshot! It\u0027s a great personal memento to add to your \"Dell Internship 2025\" folder.\n*   **☐ Note the Fiscal Year:** Slide 1 says \"FY26\". This is just a good piece of data to have for your records.\n\n---\n\n### **Slide 5: US: ADP Access \u0026 Tax documents Information**\n\n**What it means:** This confirms that the advice I gave you earlier was spot-on. Dell provides an external link for former employees to access ADP. This is your lifeline to future tax documents.\n\n**Your Action Items (Even though you\u0027ve started):**\n*   **☐ Triple-Confirm Your Access:** You\u0027ve saved your password, which is great. **Now, do exactly what the slide says.** Disconnect from the Dell VPN, go to your personal computer or phone, and test the **ADP external link**. Make 100% sure you can log in from a non-Dell device.\n*   **☐ Verify Your Personal Email is Registered:** When you log in, double-check that your personal email address (e.g., your Gmail) is listed in the profile. This is how you will reset your password in 2026 if you forget it.\n*   **☐ Save the Link Itself:** Bookmark the ADP external link in your personal browser and save the URL in a text file in your \"Dell Internship 2025\" folder.\n\n---\n\n### **Slide 6 \u0026 7: Summer Intern Housing and Taxability**\n\n**What it means:** This is the most complex and financially important part of the presentation for you.\n*   Your housing benefit/relocation stipend is **taxable income**. This means its value is added to your total earnings, and you will be taxed on it.\n*   Dell performs a \"gross-up,\" meaning they pay the estimated taxes on this benefit *for you* to lessen the burden. This is a huge help.\n*   The example on Slide 7 shows what this might look like on your W-2. Notice how Dell is paying an \"Employee portion\" and an \"Employer portion\" of taxes.\n\n**Your Action Items (CRITICAL for an F1 Student):**\n*   **☐ SAVE THESE SLIDES:** Take high-quality screenshots of slides 6 and 7 and save them in your \"Dell Internship 2025\" folder. Title them `Dell_Taxability_Explanation.png`.\n*   **☐ Understand Your FICA Exemption:** As an F1 student, you are generally exempt from Social Security and Medicare (FICA) taxes. The *example* on Slide 7 shows these taxes. Your personal W-2 in 2026 **should not** have amounts in the Social Security and Medicare boxes. The gross-up Dell pays on your behalf might include this, but it shouldn\u0027t be withheld from your pay. This is a key detail to verify on your W-2.\n*   **☐ Prepare for Tax Filing:** When you file your US taxes (Form 1040-NR) in early 2026, you or your tax preparer (e.g., Sprintax) will need this information to understand your W-2. These slides explain why your W-2 income might look higher than your cash paychecks.\n*   **☐ Save the Contact Email:** Save the email `dellgm@topia.com` in case you have questions about this later.\n\n---\n\n### **Slide 8: HR queries for team members who leave Dell**\n\n**What it means:** This slide provides your official channel for any HR-related issues after you leave (e.g., employment verification for a future visa, questions about your W-2).\n\n**Your Action Items:**\n*   **☐ Find and Bookmark the \"Alumni Solutions Form\":** Before you lose access, find this form on the Dell network. Bookmark the link and save the direct URL in your \"Dell Internship\" folder. This is your key to getting help later.\n*   **☐ Plan to Update Your Address:** Note the instruction to update your home address within 7 days of your last paycheck. This is crucial for ensuring your W-2 and any other physical mail goes to the right place.\n\n---\n\n### **Slide 9: Payroll Action Items**\n\n**What it means:** This is your final, clear payroll checklist.\n\n**Your Action Items:**\n*   **☐ Submit Final Timecard:** The #1 thing to do to ensure your final paycheck is correct. Do it and get confirmation from your manager that it\u0027s approved.\n*   **☐ Calendar Reminder for W-2:** This slide confirms your W-2 will be available in the ADP Portal in **February 2026**. Set a calendar reminder on your phone for Feb 1, 2026, right now. \"Download Dell W-2 from ADP Portal.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Slide 11: Corporate Housing**\n\n**What it means:** How to avoid losing money on cleaning/damage fees.\n\n**Your Action Items:**\n*   **☐ Document Everything:** Follow the instructions from `dellinterns@cwshousing.com` precisely.\n*   **☐ Take \"After\" Photos:** Before you leave, take a detailed video or photos of your clean room, fridge, and bathroom on your phone. This is your evidence in case of a dispute over fees.\n*   **☐ Avoid Common Fees:** Pay special attention to the big charges: **$25 per bag of trash** and **$100+ for fridge cleaning**. Don\u0027t let your final paycheck get eaten by this.\n\n---\n\n### **Slides 12, 13, \u0026 14: IT Return**\n\n**What it means:** The logistics of returning your equipment.\n\n**Your Action Items:**\n*   **☐ Know What to Return vs. Keep:**\n    *   **RETURN:** Laptop (\"System\"), Power Supply, Badge.\n    *   **KEEP:** Backpack, Headset, and Mouse! (Awesome perk).\n*   **☐ Identify Your Drop-off Location:** Based on Slide 14, you are at **Round Rock / Parmer**. Your drop-off location is the **WCA Lab (Round Rock 2 East)**.\n*   **☐ Schedule Your Drop-off:** Look at the dates and times (e.g., Aug 15, 9am-11pm \u0026 1pm-3pm). Put a specific time slot in your calendar. Don\u0027t be late.\n*   **☐ Get a Receipt:** When you drop off the equipment, ask the IT staff if they can send a confirmation email or give you a paper receipt. This is your proof of return.\n\n---\n\n### **Slide 15: What are next steps?**\n\n**What it means:** This is the most important slide for your career. It\u0027s about a potential full-time job offer.\n\n**Your Action Items:**\n*   **☐ Prepare for Feedback with Your Manager:** This is your final performance review. It\u0027s also your chance to express your strong interest in returning to Dell full-time after graduation.\n*   **☐ MONITOR YOUR PERSONAL EMAIL:** From August 1-30, Talent Acquisition will be communicating \"next steps.\" This means job offers. Check your personal email, including your spam folder, daily.\n*   **☐ Save the Contact:** Add `candidatecare@dell.com` to your email contacts so it doesn\u0027t go to spam.\n\n---\n\n### **Slide 16: Final Reminders**\n\n**What it means:** A final summary and a crucial piece of networking advice.\n\n**Your Action Items:**\n*   **☐ Review Your Checklist:** Use this slide as a final check to make sure you\u0027ve done everything (Timecard, ADP, Housing, etc.).\n*   **☐ \"Continue your relationships \u0026 mentorships\":** Before your last day, send LinkedIn connection requests to your manager, mentor, and key team members. Send a personal \"thank you\" email expressing your gratitude and desire to stay in touch. This is how an internship turns into a career.\n\nYou are in a great position. By following this guide, you will leave Dell professionally, protect yourself financially, and set yourself up perfectly for tax season and potential future job offers. Good luck",

      "text": "Of course. This is a fantastic set of documents. You have the official framework for the conversation (the feedback template) and the raw material of your accomplishments (your final project presentation). Let\u0027s coach you on how to expertly merge the two for a powerful and effective final feedback session.\n\nYour goal here is not just to \"get feedback.\" It is to **demonstrate your value, solidify your manager\u0027s positive impression, and explicitly open the door for a return offer.**\n\nHere is a slide-by-slide coaching guide on how to prepare for and navigate this crucial meeting.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 1: Preparation — Filling Out the \"Self Reflection\" Template (Slide 2)**\n\nThis is your homework. Do this *before* the meeting. Your manager will be incredibly impressed that you came prepared to this level. Use your **Fault Injection Tool** presentation as your source of truth.\n\n#### **In the \"Wins\" Box:**\n\nDon\u0027t just list tasks. Frame your accomplishments as impactful results. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) in your head.\n\n*   **INSTEAD OF:** \"Built a fault injection tool.\"\n*   **WRITE THIS:**\n    \u003e \"Successfully delivered the **Fault Injection Tool**, a TUI framework that simplifies resilience testing for the CNOS team. The tool directly addresses the challenge of manual, time-consuming testing by automating fault injection and analysis with Chaos Mesh.\"\n\n*   **INSTEAD OF:** \"We changed the project idea.\"\n*   **WRITE THIS:**\n    \u003e \"Demonstrated agility by **pivoting the project** from a general CI/CD pipeline to a targeted TUI based on a critical engineering need from the CNOS team. This ensured the project delivered immediate value by helping reproduce subtle, customer-reported bugs.\"\n\n*   **INSTEAD OF:** \"Made a UI and used AI.\"\n*   **WRITE THIS:**\n    \u003e \"Designed an intuitive Terminal User Interface (TUI) that abstracts away YAML complexity and provides real-time monitoring. Integrated a local AI engine for automated log summaries, reducing the time engineers spend on analysis.\"\n\n#### **In the \"Strengths and Things I Am Doing Well\" Box:**\n\nConnect your technical skills (Hard Skills) to professional attributes (Soft Skills). Use your \"Key Learnings \u0026 Takeaways\" slide as a guide.\n\n*   **Technical Skills (The \"What\"):**\n    \u003e \"Gained proficiency in end-to-end application development using Python, Textual, and asynchronous programming. Developed a deep understanding of Kubernetes concepts and the complexities of large-scale distributed systems like CNOS.\"\n\n*   **Professional Skills (The \"How\"):**\n    \u003e \" **Proactive Problem-Solving:** Identified the need to pivot the project to deliver more immediate value.\n    \u003e **Embracing Agile Principles:** Adapted quickly to changing requirements based on team feedback.\n    \u003e **Collaboration \u0026 Communication:** Worked effectively with my partner, Yesenia, and supervisors (Alex, Karunakara, Lin) to design and deliver the final product.\"\n\n#### **In the \"Opportunities For Development\" Box:**\n\nThis is NOT for listing weaknesses. This is for showing you are ambitious and thinking about your future growth *at Dell*. Frame it as \"What\u0027s next for me?\"\n\n*   **WRITE THIS:**\n    \u003e \"I\u0027d love to gain more exposure to integrating tools like ours into the broader CI/CD pipeline at Dell. Understanding how to automate resilience checks in Jenkins is a key area I want to grow in.\"\n    \u003e\n    \u003e \"I\u0027m also interested in learning more about how Dell measures the \u0027Business Impact\u0027 I mentioned in my presentation—specifically, how \u0027developer velocity\u0027 and \u0027operational risk\u0027 are quantified.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: The Meeting — Using the \"During Conversation\" Template (Slide 3)**\n\nThis is your game plan for the meeting itself. You will lead the conversation using the template.\n\n**1. Start the Meeting:**\n\"Hi [Manager\u0027s Name], thanks for meeting with me. I\u0027m really excited to discuss my performance and get your feedback. I\u0027ve used the performance template to prepare some thoughts on my end to help guide our conversation.\"\n\n**2. Discussing \"Wins\":**\n*   **You say:** \"To start, I reflected on what I see as the key wins from my internship, which were delivering the TUI, pivoting the project to meet a real engineering need, and integrating the AI analysis. **From your perspective, what were the most valuable deliverables or moments from my time here?**\"\n*   **Then you listen.** Take notes on their answer.\n\n**3. Discussing \"Strengths\":**\n*   **You say:** \"I also tried to identify my key strengths, focusing on both the technical skills I developed with Python and Kubernetes, and professional skills like being proactive and agile. **What strengths did you observe in me this summer? Are there any areas where you think I particularly excelled?**\"\n*   **Listen and take notes.**\n\n**4. Discussing \"Opportunities For Development\":**\n*   **You say:** \"Based on my work this summer, I\u0027m thinking about my future growth. I\u0027m really interested in learning more about CI/CD integration and business impact metrics. **What skills or areas do you think I should focus on over the next year to become a top-tier candidate for a full-time role here at Dell?**\"\n*   This is a powerful question. It shows foresight and a clear interest in returning.\n\n**5. \"Other Questions and Feedback\" - The CRITICAL Part:**\n\nThis is where you make your intentions clear and gather intelligence for a return offer.\n\n*   **Ask about the team:** \"What does a successful full-time engineer on this team look like in their first year? What are the biggest challenges they usually face?\"\n*   **Ask for blunt feedback:** \"Is there any other feedback, positive or constructive, that you have for me that would be helpful as I finish my internship and think about my career?\"\n*   **The Direct Ask:** \"**I\u0027ve truly enjoyed my time working on the Hydra team and I\u0027m very proud of the Fault Injection Tool we built.

      "text": "**Initiating the Analysis**\n\nI\u0027m starting the deep dive into the Teams screenshots, focusing on the initial breakdown of the user\u0027s request. My core task is clear: to glean insights into a Dell internship solely from these visuals. The first step is to methodically dismantle the request into its essential components.\n\n\n**Charting the Approach**\n\nI\u0027ve sketched out the initial steps for dissecting the Teams data. The key is now to convert the user\u0027s request into actionable categories: Actions, People, Files, Links, and Next steps. I\u0027ll need to develop a strategy for a chronological, topic-based breakdown of the provided screenshots. The continuous nature of the chat means I\u0027ll need to group messages by date and logical flow for optimal clarity. The initial scan also revealed the presence of dates, so I\u0027m set to establish a timeline.\n\n\n**Refining the Framework**\n\nI\u0027m now expanding the analysis framework to include nuances gleaned from the initial overview. The \"Next\" category will now also encompass any decisions made or action items assigned. I\u0027m focusing on the \"CNOS Intern Project: Fault Injection Tool\" topic, and identifying the key players and their roles. I am grouping screenshots by date and topic, and noting the recurring patterns in the technical discussions.\n\n\n**Defining the Structure**\n\nMy current focus is crafting a clear structure for the analysis, centered on the user\u0027s template. I\u0027m actively establishing categories like \"Actions,\" \"People,\" and \"Links\" to systematically extract key details from the Teams screenshots. I\u0027m focusing on parsing the technical terms and identifying the main discussion threads. The goal is to produce a well-organized, chronological report. I\u0027m ready to begin the walkthrough.\n\n\n**Expanding the Scope**\n\nI\u0027ve started integrating the details from the \"Spike\" discussion, noting the \"Action,\" \"People,\" and \"Links.\" The analysis now encompasses the details from Screenshots 1-5. I am noting the specifics of the \"Spike\" experiment, the nodes being tested, and the associated actions. I\u0027m focusing on \"enter-maint\" and relevant curl requests, including the nodes.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Technical Landscape**\n\nI\u0027m now integrating the knowledge from the \"Spike\" experiment with the technical setup discussions. I am carefully documenting the essential curl requests and Kubernetes commands as I uncover them. The analysis now extends to the specific nodes used and their operational status. I\u0027m focusing on \"enter-maint\" requests and \"kubectl\" commands for clarity and accuracy. I\u0027m ready to move onto the next stage.\n\n\n**Structuring the Analysis**\n\nI\u0027m now building the final report format, incorporating my template. I\u0027m grouping the messages by date and topic, and fleshing out each section: Actions, People, Files, Links, and Next steps. I\u0027m focusing on providing context to the technical discussions, and maintaining an organized, clear structure for easy comprehension.\n\n\n**Initiating the Breakdown**\n\nI\u0027m now starting a more structured breakdown of the Teams conversations, using a date-focused approach.

Here is a detailed log of your internship activities, interactions, and resources, extracted chronologically from your Microsoft Teams screenshots.\n\n---\n\n**Monday, June 2**\n*   **Action:** Started the \"CNOS Intern Project: Fault Injection Tool.\" Received initial project documentation and architectural specifications for key services (CMS, CNOS, AOS, DOS). Asked a clarifying question about VM assignments for the \"Spike\" (a focused research task).\n*   **People:** maguluri, srinivasa; Andrew Yunt; Xiuyan Wang.\n*   **Links:**\n    *   Santorini Deployment Main Page (Confluence)\n    *   Santorini Cluster Management Service (CMS) Functional Specification (Confluence)\n    *   Santorini Manageability (Confluence)\n    *   Santorini Cluster and Node Orchestration Service (CNOS) Architecture Specification (Confluence)\n    *   Santorini Scale-out Application Orchestrator Service (AOS) Functional Specification (Confluence)\n    *   Application Orchestrator Service Architecture Specification (Confluence)\n    *   Santorini Deployment Service Function Specification (Confluence)\n    *   Santorini Cluster Infra Bare + Metal + Clusters (Confluence)\n*   **Next:** Follow up on cluster assignments.\n\n**Tuesday, June 3**\n*   **Action:** Participated in the creation and refinement of the Jira epic for the intern project. The initial broad scope was narrowed down based on feedback to focus specifically on node/system-level failures using Chaos Mesh.\n*   **People:** Wang, Xiuyan; maguluri, srinivasa; Guo, Lin.\n*   **Links:**\n    *   Jira Epic: `https://jira.cec.lab.emc.com/browse/CPE07E-312`\n*   **Next:** Begin working on the project with the newly defined, narrower scope.\n\n**Wednesday, June 4**\n*   **Action:** Received the updated project requirements from Lin. Began the \"spike\" with Yesenia to understand the `enter-maint` process. Discovered the correct `curl` request and identified safe nodes to use for executing commands by checking `kubectl get nodes`.\n*   **People:** Guo, Lin; Wang, Xiuyan; May, Alexander; Yesenia Hernandez.\n*   **Files:** Screenshot of `kubectl get nodes` output, showing \"safe\" nodes.\n*   **Next:** Follow logs (infracnos, aos) and use `kubectl get cna` to check the status of the node operation.\n\n**Thursday, June 5**\n*   **Action:** Worked on setting up the `temporal` CLI for workflow management. Ran into a permissions issue with adding new environment variables to the system PATH. Was assigned to Cluster 13 (Durham). Learned that `temporal` is accessed by executing a shell inside the `cmswfserver` pod and that creating an alias is recommended. Received warnings about avoiding maintenance operations on nodes running `http-share` or `nfs-server`.\n*   **People:** May, Alexander; Yesenia Hernandez; Guo, Lin.\n*   **Links:**\n    *   Cluster assignment page (from Alexander\u0027s message)\n    *   How to graceful reboot/shutdown a node on a Santorini RM cluster (Confluence)\n*   **Next:** Use the assigned Cluster 13 and be careful with node selection.\n\n**Friday, June 6**\n*   **Action:** Investigated the difference between monitoring workflows via Temporal CLI vs. `kubectl get cna`. Concluded that `cna` is the easiest way to see the high-level result, while `temporal` provides more granular, step-by-step workflow details. Learned about the relationship between CNA (a Custom Resource) and Temporal Workflows.\n*   **People:** Seenivasan, Ohm; May, Alexander; Wang, Xiuyan.\n*   **Files:** Screenshots of a temporal payload, `temporal workflows list` output, and a system architecture diagram.\n*   **Links:**\n    *   Durable Execution Solutions | Temporal\n*   **Decision:** Use `kubectl get cna` for primary status checks and `temporal` for deeper debugging.\n\n**Monday, June 9**\n*   **Action:** Discussed the difference between the iDRAC GUI and the customer-facing Hydra GUI. Clarified that iDRAC is for hardware management, separate from the product\u0027s UI. Created two new Jira stories for the upcoming sprint.\n*   **People:** Wang, Xiuyan; May, Alexander; Guo, Lin.\n*   **Files:** Screenshot of iDRAC \"System is Healthy\" dashboard.\n*   **Links:**\n    *   Confluence link for Hydra UI mock-ups\n*   **Next:** Begin work on the new sprint stories.\n\n**Tuesday, June 10**\n*   **Action:** Prepared to complete the CI/CD familiarization spike. Identified remaining blockers: `storagesvc`, `ECS`, and `qTest` access. Resolved `storagesvc` and `ECS` issues. Followed up on `qTest` access and GitHub repo access (UoM Team `dp-appliances/ddos`). Clarified the difference between `NodeMaintenance` and `PowerCycle` Jenkins pipelines.\n*   **People:** May, Alexander; maguluri, srinivasa; Tim Mac (qTest admin); Wang, Xiuyan; Karunakara Seelam.\n*   **Files:** `Spike_Help.mkv`; `Storage Service 1.pptx`.\n*   **Links:**\n    *   Dell Elastic Cloud Storage page\n    *   qTest project links (Hydra ID: 391, DDOS ID: 101)\n    *   GitHub UoM Team repo: `https://eos2git.cec.lab.emc.com/dp-appliances/ddos`\n*   **Decision:** The spike is complete. The next steps are to start learning Chaos Mesh.\n\n**Wednesday, June 11**\n*   **Action:** Gained access to the GitHub repo. Began setting up the development environment by cloning the repo to the dev VM. Started installing Chaos Mesh but encountered PodSecurity policy errors.\n*   **People:** May, Alexander; Seenivasan, Ohm; Le, Dave.\n*   **Links:**\n    *   Confluence link for Git developer process\n*   **Next:** Investigate and resolve the pod security policy issues to get Chaos Mesh running.\n\n**Thursday, June 12**\n*   **Action:** Successfully resolved the Chaos Mesh installation issue. The problem was Kubernetes rejecting pods due to the namespace\u0027s PodSecurity policy. Fixed it by relabeling the `chaos-mesh` namespace to `enforce\u003dprivileged`.\n*   **People:** May, Alexander.\n*   **Links:**\n    *   `https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/`\n*   **Decision:** The approach of explicitly setting the namespace security level to privileged is the correct one.\n\n**Monday, June 23**\n*   **Action:** Began preparing for the Chaos Mesh presentation. Asked for feedback on demo videos (`1_Carl-Installing...`, `2_Carl-Podkill...`) showing the general use of `PodChaos`.\n*   **People:** Guo, Lin; May, Alexander.\n*   **Files:** `1_Carl-Installing Chaos Mesh.mkv`; `2_Carl-Podkill.mkv`.\n*   **Next:** Incorporate feedback into the presentation.\n\n**Tuesday, June 24 - Wednesday, June 25**\n*   **Action:** Experienced issues with a shared GitLab repo (404 errors). Added collaborators directly as a workaround. Investigated `chaosd` for node chaos simulation. Ran into a cluster issue where the `santorini` cluster status was `Failed`. Debugged the issue, identifying it was related to a node being stuck in maintenance mode (`Ready,SchedulingDisabled`). Collaborated with the team to understand the root cause (FTT at capacity) and potential solutions.\n*   **People:** May, Alexander; Guo, Lin; Hernandez, Yesenia; Wang, Xiuyan.\n*   **Links:**\n    *   `https://eos2git.cec.lab.emc.com/CarlVincentLadres-Kh/intern-journey_25SUMR/.../README.md`\n    *   `https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/chaosd-overview/#download-and-deploy`\n\n**Thursday, June 26**\n*   **Action:** Continued deep-dive debugging of a failed chaos experiment. Collaborated with Andrew and Harsh to troubleshoot `kubectl delete httpchaos`. Identified the issue was a local YAML file problem, not a cluster object problem, and fixed it by correcting the YAML.\n*   **People:** Ragdwala, Harsh; Yunt, Andrew; May, Alexander.\n*   **Decision:** Confirmed the correct YAML made the experiment run successfully and enabled deletion. No blockers.\n\n**Monday, June 30 - Tuesday, July 1**\n*   **Action:** Re-scheduled a team meeting. Assigned Jira ticket `CPE07E-168` by Lin. Began investigating a `longhorn` (storage) issue that was blocking progress; ran the `lhinstall.sh` script but it failed. Debugged the script failure with Alexander, identifying a missing `nfs` pod.\n*   **People:** May, Alexander; Guo, Lin; Ragdwala, Harsh; Yesenia Hernandez.\n*   **Links:**\n    *   Jira: `https://jira.cec.lab.emc.com/browse/CPE07E-168`\n*   **Next:** Attempt a full cluster redeployment via Jenkins pipeline to fix the underlying storage issue.\n\n**Wednesday, July 2**\n*   **Action:** A Jenkins E2E deployment fixed the underlying cluster and storage issues. Successfully ran a manual `curl` to the AOS precheck endpoint and got a `202 Accepted` response, establishing a working baseline for the \"happy path\" before injecting chaos. This unblocked the main task.\n*   **People:** May, Alexander; Le, Dave; Guo, Lin.\n*   **Links:**\n    *   Jenkins build link (`...Santorini_E2E_deployment #18262`)\n    *   Hydra cluster-nodes API documentation link\n*   **Decision:** The precheck API call is now working. Ready to proceed with `HttpChaos` testing.\n\n**Monday, July 7 - Tuesday, July 8**\n*   **Action:** Encountered a `curl: (35) OpenSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL` error when trying to apply the 503 error experiment. Debugged with Lin, discovering the issue was using `https` instead of `http`. Successfully injected an `abort` fault and recorded a video of the process. Discussed with Lin how to make the experiment return a visible 503 error code instead of just a failed connection.\n*   **People:** Guo, Lin; May, Alexander; Hernandez, Yesenia; Wang, Xiuyan.\n*   **Files:** `3_Successful-503-abort_070725.mkv`; `2025-07-08 16-02-15.mkv`.\n*   **Next:** Work on specifically returning a 503 message. Prepare for the Thursday CNOS meeting.\n\n**Wednesday, July 9**\n*   **Action:** Investigated why `HTTPChaos` was not returning a specific 503 status code. After extensive debugging involving Istio sidecars, PeerAuthentication, and even Istio\u0027s native fault injection, concluded the issue was a fundamental network policy blocking the traffic at a low level, preventing a clean 503 response. Wrote up a detailed summary of \"THE JOURNEY SO FAR\".\n*   **People:** Guo, Lin.\n*   **Next:** Regroup to find an alternative way to demonstrate the intended failure.\n\n**Thursday, July 10**\n*   **Action:** Planned the final presentation, including highlighting recovery images for pod-chaos and re-recording the NetworkChaos demo.\n*   **People:** Ragdwala, Harsh; Guo, Lin; Wang, Xiuyan; May, Alexander.\n*   **Links:**\n    *   Link to `cnos/values.yaml` in the repo.\n    *   GitHub link for `chaos-mesh` `values.yaml`\n*   **Next:** Finalize presentation slides and demos.\n\n**Wednesday, July 16 - Tuesday, July 29**\n*   **Action:** Final sprint push. Verified the cloned `ddos` repo was working. Finalized the plan for the presentation. Developed and improved the \"quick install\" for the solution using `Makefiles`. Showcased major feature adds to the tool like dynamic input validation and live log streaming.\n*   **People:** Seelam, Karunakara; Guo, Lin; Wang, Xiuyan; Hernandez, Yesenia; Ragdwala, Harsh; Le, Dave.\n*   **Files:** `AI+Refac Ver.mkv`; `Revised Plan - FaultInjection CLI.mkv`; `SIMPLER Installation.mkv`.\n*   **Next:** Present the final demo.\n\n**Wednesday, July 30 - Friday, August 1**\n*   **Action:** Put the local LLM feature on hold due to slow performance without a GPU. Learned and implemented proxyjumping for direct `kubectl` access to the bare-metal cluster. Shared final presentation drafts and received feedback from mentors.\n*   **People:** Seelam, Karunakara; Guo, Lin.\n*   **Files:** `Final Chaos Mesh Demo | draft 1.pptx`; `Juan 1to1 Presentation Feedback.mkv`.\n*   **Next:** Finalize presentation content based on feedback.\n\n**Monday, August 4 - Wednesday, August 6**\n*   **Action:** Final preparations for the intern demos. Clarified questions about the presentation content with mentors. Received final instructions on timing (10-12 mins for slides/demo, 3 mins Q\u0026A). Received final good luck messages from the team.\n*   **People:** Le, Dave; Seelam, Karunakara; Narayanaswamy, Rajeev; Guo, Lin; Hernandez, Yesenia; May, Alexander.\n*   **Files:** `S2 Intern Demos.pptx`.\n*   **Next:** Deliver the final presentation.\n\n---\n\nThis documentation provides a detailed, day-by-day log of your internship progress, from initial project scoping and environment setup to deep-diving into technical challenges and collaborating with the team to deliver the final project.",

I asked Alexander about the \"Athena\" testing framework and its relation to the DDOS repo, as we previously had issues with access. I also proposed a live, hands-on session with Alexander to walk through a Jenkins request submission to solidify my understanding of the process.

I developed tests using mock data to validate the expected user flow and posted a screenshot showing that all tests for the `TestYamlGenerator` passed. I also created and shared a screen recording of the installation process.\n*   **People:** Kho, Carl Vincent Ladres (myself).\n*   **Files:** `SIMPLER Installation.mkv`.\n*   **Links:** None.\n*   **Next:** Continue developing and testing the tool\u0027s user flow.\n\n### [Wednesday, July 30, 2025]\n\n*   **Action:** Made and announced a key project decision. I decided to put the local LLM feature on hold indefinitely.\n*   **People:** Kho, Carl Vincent Ladres (myself).\n*   **Files:** None.\n*   **Links:** None.\n*   **Next:** The project will proceed without the local LLM feature, which was deemed too slow to run without a dedicated cluster GPU. This pivots the project to focus on its other core features.\n\n### Thursday, June 26, 2025\n\n**[1:38 PM - 2:00 PM]**\n*   **Action:** Troubleshooted a `kubectl delete` command that was failing.

The error log (`spec.action: Invalid value: \"bug\"`) revealed a typo in my YAML file. I realized the Kubernetes object was never being created due to this validation error, even though the local YAML file existed. The team explained the distinction between a local file (blueprint) and a cluster object (instance).\n*   **People:** May, Alexander; Yunt, Andrew\n*   **Next:** I need to correct the `spec.action` value in my `fail-aos-precheck.yaml` file from \"bug\" to a valid action like \"abort\" or \"delay\".\n\n**[2:14 PM]**\n*   **Action:** Confirmed that correcting the YAML file fixed the issue.

After correcting it, I confirmed the command was now successful, returning a `202 Accepted` status.\n*   **People:** Guo, Lin\n*   **Files:** None\n*   **Links:** None\n*   **Next:** The connection issue is resolved. Proceed with fault injection testing.\n\n**Monday, July 7, 2025, 1:50 PM**\n*   **Action:** Provided a status update on a new problem. After fixing the namespace issue, we were now facing a `expected docker:// but got containerd://` error.

I also provided context that this work was previously blocked by a namespace error.\n*   **People:** Team (May, Alexander; Guo, Lin; Hernandez, Yesenia)\n*   **Files:** None\n*   **Links:** None\n*   **Next:** The next step is to make the API return a specific 503 error message.\n\n**Monday, July 7, 2025, 2:18 PM**\n*   **Action:** Participated in a meeting where progress was discussed. May, Alexander summarized that Yesenia and I would focus on automating the fault injection steps into a Python script once they are fully confirmed.\n*   **People:** May, Alexander; Hernandez, Yesenia; Guo, Lin; Myself (Carl Vincent Ladres)\n*   **Files:** None\n*   **Links:** None\n*   **Decision:** The team decided to automate the manual steps via a Python script.

This meeting with Karunakara isn\u0027t just a review; it\u0027s your final opportunity to demonstrate your growth, professionalism, and interest in a full-time role.\n\nUsing the wealth of information from your project work, Teams chats, and final presentation, I have pre-filled the \"Self-Reflection\" template for you. Below that is a complete agenda and a list of strategic questions to guide your conversation.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 1: Your Pre-Filled Self-Reflection Template (Your \"Proof\")**\n\nThis is your prep work. Review these points so you can speak to them confidently.\n\n#### **Wins** (Key accomplishments and deliverables)\n\n*   **Delivered End-to-End Fault Injection Tool:** Successfully designed, built, and delivered a complete Terminal User Interface (TUI) for the CNOS team. This tool directly addresses the engineering need to simplify and automate resilience testing by providing a user-friendly way to execute Chaos Mesh experiments.\n*   **Dramatically Improved Developer Experience:** Transformed the tool\u0027s setup from a complex, multi-step process requiring 20+ minutes of documentation reading into a simple, two-command installation using Makefiles (`make install`, `make run`). This makes the tool accessible and practical for daily use by the team.\n*   **Demonstrated Agility and Business Acumen:** Pivoted the project\u0027s initial scope based on direct engineering feedback (from Lin Guo and the team). This shift from a general concept to a targeted, TUI-based solution ensured the final product addressed a critical, real-world need: reproducing complex, intermittent failures.\n*   **Showcased Deep Technical Problem-Solving:** Successfully diagnosed and resolved multiple, significant cluster-level blockers. This includes leading the investigation into the Longhorn storage issue and the complex Istio vs. Chaos Mesh network conflict, demonstrating resilience and an ability to navigate enterprise-level infrastructure challenges.\n\n#### **Strengths and Things I Am Doing Well**\n\n*   **Technical Acumen \u0026 Rapid Learning:** Mastered end-to-end application development in a new domain using Python and the Textual framework. Quickly gained a deep, practical knowledge of Kubernetes, Chaos Mesh, and the architecture of complex distributed systems like CNOS, AOS, and CMS.\n*   **Proactive Initiative \u0026 Ownership:** Consistently took initiative beyond the initial project scope. When the local LLM feature proved too slow, I made the decisive call to put it on hold. When the installation process was cumbersome, I proactively re-engineered it with Makefiles. This shows strong ownership and a focus on delivering value.\n*   **Collaboration and Professional Communication:** Worked seamlessly with my co-intern, Yesenia. Maintained clear, professional, and frequent communication with my mentors (Alexander May, Lin Guo) and management (Karunakara). I actively sought feedback (e.g., on the final presentation) and incorporated it effectively.\n*   **Resilience and \"Founder Mentality\":** Faced significant technical blockers that could have derailed the project (storage failures, network policy issues, installation hurdles). Instead of waiting, I treated each as a problem to be solved, collaborated with senior engineers, documented the journey, and always found a path forward.\n\n#### **Opportunities For Development**\n\n*   **CI/CD Integration:** I\u0027m eager to learn the practical steps of integrating an internal tool like this into Dell\u0027s official Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. Understanding how to automate these resilience checks as part of the standard build process is the logical next step for this project.\n*   **Measuring Business Impact:** My presentation mentioned \"reducing operational risk\" and \"increasing developer velocity.\" I would love to learn more about how Dell\u0027s engineering teams formally measure these metrics (KPIs) to better connect my technical work to business outcomes.\n*   **Advanced System-Level Debugging:** I learned so much from diagnosing the Longhorn and Istio issues. I want to continue to grow my skills in this area. Understanding the key tools and log sources senior engineers use during a critical site outage is a major area of interest for me.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: Meeting Agenda \u0026 Strategic Questions for Karunakara**\n\nHere is your agenda and a script to guide the conversation.\n\n**Meeting Agenda (30 Minutes)**\n\n1.  **(2 min) Opening:** Quick check-in and setting the context.\n2.  **(10 min) My Reflections on Wins \u0026 Strengths:** Share your prepared points and ask for his perspective.\n3.  **(10 min) His Feedback \u0026 My Opportunities for Growth:** Actively listen to his feedback and then share your \"Opportunities for Development\" to show you\u0027re thinking ahead.\n4.  **(8 min) Discussing Next Steps \u0026 Future at Dell:** The most important part—where you express interest in a return offer.\n\n#### **Questions to Ask Karunakara (During the Conversation)**\n\n**Section 1: On Wins \u0026 Strengths**\n\n*   \"To start, I reflected on what I see as the key wins: delivering the end-to-end TUI, improving the developer experience with the new installer, and navigating the technical blockers. **From your perspective, what was the most valuable contribution I made this summer?**\"\n*   \"I identified my main strengths as my technical learning speed, my proactive initiative, and my resilience when faced with problems. **What strengths did you observe in me, and what aspects of my work set me apart?**\"\n\n**Section 2: On Feedback \u0026 Opportunities**\n\n*   *(After he gives you feedback, you transition by saying...)* \"Thank you, that\u0027s really helpful. It aligns with how I\u0027ve been thinking about my own growth. I\u0027ve been considering what I need to learn next to be a high-impact engineer here...\"\n*   \"Based on your experience, what one or two skills are the most critical for a new full-time software engineer to succeed on this team?\"\n*   \"I\u0027m really interested in the CI/CD integration aspect of this project. **What opportunities for development do you see for me that would make me an even more successful team member if I were to return?**\"\n\n**Section 3: The Crucial Closing Questions (The \"Ask\")**\n\n*   \"Karunakara, I\u0027ve genuinely enjoyed my internship here. I was challenged by the complexity of the Hydra system, and I\u0027m very proud of the Fault Injection Tool we built. I believe the work we\u0027re doing in resilience engineering is incredibly important.\"\n*   **\"Based on my work this summer, I am very interested in a full-time role with the team after I graduate. Could you share what the next steps in that process look like?**\"\n*   *(Optional, if the conversation is going well):* \"Is there any other feedback you have for me, or anything else I can do in my final weeks to solidify the team\u0027s decision?\"\n\nBy preparing with this structured approach, you will walk into that meeting ready to not only receive feedback but to actively shape a positive outcome for your future career at Dell.
