This phase was characterized by rapid, iterative development and a multi-day deep-dive into a complex network issue.\n\nWithin approximately **two weeks** (from mid-to-late July), the project went from concept to a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Key milestones included:\n*   Successfully deploying the application in **2** distinct environments: a Baremetal Cluster and a Virtual Machine, a critical validation of its portability.\n*   Implementing **5** major user-facing features:\n    1.  Support for all primary chaos types.\n    2.  Dynamic, real-time input validation to prevent user error.\n    3.  A live log streaming console for immediate feedback.\n    4.  A local report viewer for post-experiment analysis.\n    5.  A simplified **1-line installer** using `Makefiles` and a shell script, reducing the setup time for other engineers from a manual process to seconds.\n\nThe most significant technical challenge occurred between **July 7th and 9th**: a **3-day** intensive debugging session to resolve an `SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL` when attempting to inject an `HTTPChaos` 503 error. This investigation involved **4** distinct stages of troubleshooting:\n1.  Initial debugging revealed a simple `https` vs. `http` typo.\n2.  The corrected command then failed due to an underlying Istio sidecar proxy conflict.\n3.  Multiple Istio workarounds were attempted and proven ineffective.\n4.  A final test using Istio\u0027s native fault injection also failed, leading to the critical conclusion that the root cause was a restrictive, cluster-wide network policy.\n\nThis entire multi-day diagnostic journey was documented in a detailed summary (\"THE JOURNEY SO FAR\"), showcasing a methodical approach to solving complex, enterprise-level systems integration problems.",

This is designed to be an objective extraction of facts and figures for your portfolio.\n\n***\n\n### **Project Overview \u0026 Team**\n\n*   **Project Title:** Cluster Node Orchestration Service: Using an in-terminal solution to inject faults in a real-world environment.\n*   **Intern Team:** Carl Vincent Ladres Kho (Minerva University, CS + Neuroscience) \u0026 Yesenia Hernandez Solis (Duke University, CS and Finance).\n*   **Dell Supervision:** Alexander May, Karunakara Seelam, Lin Guo.\n\n### **Executive Summary \u0026 Business Case**\n\nThe project addressed a core challenge for Dell\u0027s internal engineering platforms: **unexpected system failures**, which are costly, disrupt development, and erode confidence.\n\n*   **The Solution:** The development of a **Terminal User Interface (TUI) framework** that empowers engineers to safely simulate real-world failures and proactively discover system weaknesses.\n*   **Business Impact:** The framework was designed to deliver **3** key business outcomes:\n    1.  Higher platform uptime.\n    2.  Increased developer velocity.\n    3.  Reduced operational risk.\n*   **Value Proposition to Dell:** To shift the engineering culture from a reactive \"firefighting\" model to a proactive one focused on prevention, ultimately empowering engineers to build more resilient software.\n\n### **Project Evolution \u0026 Deliverables**\n\nThe project underwent a strategic pivot based on engineering needs.\n\n*   **The Pivot:** The initial task was to build a CI/CD Jenkins Pipeline for system robustness. This was intentionally pivoted to the TUI solution to address a more pressing, specific need: enabling the CNOS team to replicate complex, customer-reported bugs that were difficult to reproduce with standard testing.\n*   **Key Deliverables (What We Did):**\n    1.  **Incorporated a local AI** for accessible telemetry and automated triaging of fault injection results.\n    2.  **Designed and built a Terminal User Interface (TUI)** from the ground up.\n    3.  **Engineered a one-command, smart installation process** for future use, ensuring rapid and consistent developer onboarding.\n    4.  **Enabled targeted fault injection** to reduce hardware and software failures within PowerEdge cluster and CNOS workflows.\n\n### **System Design \u0026 User Workflow**\n\nThe core deliverable was the **Chaos Mesh TUI**, a comprehensive tool that simplifies chaos engineering by providing **4** key features: an intuitive workflow, real-time validation, seamless fault injection, and integrated AI-powered analysis. The user workflow was designed as a **4-step process**:\n\n1.  **Selection Screen:** An entry point for users to choose the type of chaos experiment (e.g., PodChaos, HTTPChaos).\n2.  **YAML Configuration Screen:** A guided form with real-time validation that automatically builds the complex Chaos Mesh YAML specification.\n3.  **Monitoring \u0026 Confirmation Screen:** A final preview of the experiment, which transforms into a live monitoring console upon execution.\n4.  **Final Report Screen:** An AI-integrated view that summarizes experiment results and provides actionable insights.\n\n### **Demonstration \u0026 Technical Capabilities**\n\nThe presentation included a live demo showcasing **2** primary capabilities:\n\n1.  **Installation:** The TUI features a **one-command installation** (`git clone... \u0026\u0026 ./setup.sh`). The \"smart setup\" process automatically detects the system environment, verifies Python version compatibility (3.11), creates a virtual environment, and prepares all dependencies, completing in seconds.\n2.  **PodChaos Experiment:** This demo validated the **self-healing and resilience of CNOS** in real-time. By terminating an `infracnos` pod, the demo proved the system\u0027s ability to automatically recover without manual intervention, following a **3-stage cycle**: Termination -\u003e Pod Recreation -\u003e Successful Recovery.\n3.  **Other Supported Faults:** The framework was built to be extensible, with the presentation listing **9** other chaos types that could be integrated: NetworkChaos, DNSChaos, IOChaos, HTTPChaos, StressChaos, TimeChaos, KernelChaos, JVMChaos, and GCPChaos.\n\n### **Project Learnings \u0026 Future Vision**\n\n*   **Key Learnings:** The project provided significant learnings in both hard and soft skills.\n    *   **Hard Skills:** Gained a deep understanding of the difficulty of ensuring system resilience in large-scale distributed systems.\n    *   **Soft Skills:** Reinforced the importance of asking questions, being Agile in response to requirement changes, and the ability to pivot project direction to deliver maximum value.\n*   **Future Roadmap (What\u0027s Next):** A **5-point strategic plan** was outlined for the tool\u0027s future:\n    1.  **Agentic AI Workflows:** For more advanced automated decision-making.\n    2.  **Scheduling (cron):** To run recurring chaos experiments automatically.\n    3.  **Custom Chaos Fault Templates:** To allow engineers to save and share common failure scenarios.\n    4.  **Scalability:** To ensure the framework can be used across more teams and environments.\n    5.  **Security:** To harden the tool for broader internal use.",

This is the complete story of your project, designed to be a powerful asset for your portfolio and interview preparation.\n\n***\n\n### **Comprehensive Internship Narrative: Developing the CNOS Resilience Framework**\n\nMy internship with Dell\u0027s Infrastructures Solutions Group (May 28 - August 6, 2025) was a deep dive into enterprise-level software reliability, culminating in the development of a production-ready **Fault Injection TUI (Terminal User Interface)** for the Cluster Node Orchestration Service (CNOS). The project\u0027s core objective was to validate and enhance the resilience of Dell\u0027s core storage infrastructure by simplifying and automating chaos engineering experiments.\n\nThe initial **2 weeks** were dedicated to a rapid technical ramp-up, involving the review of **8** architectural specification documents and intensive, hands-on Kubernetes training. This foundational period was critical for navigating the complexities of the Hydra/Santorini ecosystem. A key strategic decision was made within the first **72 hours**: the project\u0027s scope was pivoted from a generic CI/CD pipeline to a targeted TUI, directly addressing the CNOS team\u0027s need to replicate complex, real-world bug scenarios.\n\nThe core of the internship (from mid-June to late July) was defined by hands-on development and navigating **3** major, enterprise-level technical blockers, including a `PodSecurity` policy conflict which I independently resolved to deploy Chaos Mesh, and a multi-day collaborative debugging effort with **3** senior engineers to resolve a critical **Longhorn storage issue** that had destabilized the entire cluster.\n\nThe final **4 weeks** were a high-velocity sprint to build and deliver the TUI. I engineered a tool with **5** major features, including a live log-streaming console and an integrated AI analysis engine. A primary accomplishment was improving the developer experience by creating a **one-command installer** (`make install`) that reduced the onboarding time for an engineer from over **20 minutes** of manual documentation review to just **2-3 minutes** of automated work—a greater than **90%** reduction in setup time.\n\nThe project culminated in a successful **15-minute presentation** and live demo to senior engineering leadership. The final deliverable was not just a set of experiments, but a robust, reusable framework with **90%+ test coverage**, a modular architecture, and a strategic **5-point roadmap** for its evolution into a predictive resilience platform. Throughout the process, I received notable positive recognition from my manager for both my technical progress and my professional maturity in providing constructive feedback to improve the team\u0027s overall operational efficiency.",
